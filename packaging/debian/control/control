Description: Modernized classic ncurses multiplayer fantasy war game
 ConquerV5 is the modernized version of the classic multiplayer fantasy war game
 originally created by Ed Barlow and Adam Bryant between 1987-1992. This version
 features a completely rewritten build system with cross-platform support while
 preserving the authentic 1980s Unix gaming experience.
 .
 This modernized version includes:
  * Cross-platform build system with automatic platform detection
  * Support for modern compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
  * Improved dependency handling and error diagnostics
  * Enhanced installation paths and configuration
  * Proper package management integration
  * All original gameplay features preserved
 .
 Terminal-based gaming features:
  * Full ncurses terminal user interface
  * Multiplayer gameplay with multiple administrators
  * Multiple fantasy war scenarios with different maps
  * Magical powers and comprehensive spell system
  * Large variety of unit types and tactical options
  * Support for maps larger than the original 256x256 grid
  * Screen-based real-time display and interaction
 .
 The modernized build system automatically detects your platform (Linux, macOS,
 FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD) and configures appropriate compiler flags and
 dependencies. It generates optimized Makefiles for your specific system while
 maintaining compatibility with the original game mechanics.
 .
 Perfect for terminal enthusiasts, retro gaming fans, and developers interested
 in classic Unix game architecture. This package brings the authentic 1980s
 Unix gaming experience to modern Debian and Ubuntu systems with contemporary
 build tools and package management.
