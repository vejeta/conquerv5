
Conqueresque Economics

     Economic  conditions  play  a crucial role in the development and
     growth of a nation within Conquer.   Each  nation  must  properly
     manage  the  resources  available, and distribute them where they
     are needed.  Troops will need supplies in order to  survive,  and
     ships  and  caravans  will need materials for contruction and re­
     pairs.  Civilians will need food during every turn, and the  sec­
     tors  will  need  materials  just to keep current designations in
     place, if not to build new ones.

     All of the economics issues revolve around the ability of the na­
     tion  to  acquire  and  distribute the materials available to it.
     And there are many methods available for both the acquisition and
     the  distribution,  it is up to the player controlling the nation
     to decide what is best and when.

Economics 101: Resources

     There are five types of raw materials  within  Conquer:   talons,
     metals,  jewels,  wood  and food.  Each is required for different
     uses, and each must be produced in different ways:

     Talons -- The basic monetary unit of  conquer,  gold  talons  are
     generated from the taxation of the population.  The taxation lev­
     el is totally controllable by the player, so if more  talons  are
     needed,  more taxes can be gathered.  Of course, with higher tax­
     es, there is much higher discontent, and a greater risk of rebel­
     lion  against  your  rule.  The amount of talons generated varies
     with the type of the sector and the  sector  population;  lumber­
     yards, iron mines, jewel mines, and the farm sectors all generate
     talons based on the production of the sector.  The remaining sec­
     tors  have a fixed income for each person in the sector, which is
     greater if the sector is of more importance.

     Metals -- Metals are used in the construction  of  buildings  and
     fortifications,  as well as the supplying of many troops.  Metals
     are generated by mining them from  the  earth.   Various  sectors
     contain  metal  deposits,  such  as  iron, copper, adamantine and
     mithril.  These sectors have available to them a  certain  amount
     of  metal,  which  is related to the quality of the type of metal
     within the sector; for each unit of metal  value  for  a  sector,
     each  miner  within  the  sector will produce 1 unit of metal per
     turn.  But, finding the metals is not as simple as it  might  be.
     Each  nation  has given "mining ability" and "metalworking abili­
     ty", the average of which is used to compute  the  likelihood  of
     being  able  to  recognize  the metallic tradegoods.  In order to
     find the better metal types, the nation  must  possess  a  better
     mining and metalworking ability.

     Jewels  --  Jewels  are used to gain the services of various mon­
     sters, and to increase the magic powers and energy of  a  nation.
     Jewels,  really  gems and precious metals, are produced very much
     like metals.  There are various forms of jewel types, such as ru­
     bies,  gold,  silver  and  platinum.  And each nation possesses a
     certain level of ability for  finding  and  mining  such  jewels.
     Much  like  with  Metals,  nations  have a "jewelworking" ability
     which, when averaged with  the  mining  ability  determines  what
     types of jewels are able to be mined by the nation.

     Wood -- Wood is used in the construction of naval vessels and for
     defensive fortifications.  As such, wood is a military necessity.
     Wood  is  gained through the use of lumberyards.  Each vegetation
     type has a certain wood yield which it may give, where woods  and
     forests  have the highest production potential.  Special types of
     trees, such as pine and oak, may also enhance  the  yield  for  a
     sector.   For each wood value a sector possesses, it will produce
     ten units of wood per person.

     Food -- Food is a necessity of life, for both soldiers and civil­
     ians.  If soldiers or civilians run out of food supplies they are
     likely to die of starvation.  Farms are used to  grow  food,  but
     the farms must be properly cultivated over a number of seasons or
     only a partial crop will result.  A normal yield  is  1  unit  of
     food per person, per food value of the sector, each turn.  During
     the spring, a sector must be designated as a "Farm" sector.  This
     sector  will  produce  a half yield.  As the seasons progress the
     farm will mature and become  "Fertile"  during  the  summer,  and
     "Fruitful"  during  the fall.  The fertile sectors will produce a
     full yield, while the fruitful  sectors  will  produce  a  double
     yield.   During  winter,  the sector will revert back to a "Farm"
     sector, and will not produce food again until the spring.

Economics 201: Supply and Demand

     Raw materials are stored within the special storage designations,
     called  "supply  centers".   There  are five supply center types:
     Cache, Stockade, Town, City, and Capital.  Materials stored with­
     in  any  of these designations will be made access to neighboring
     sectors, military units and civilians.  If  a  unit,  sector,  or
     civilian  does not receive the resources needed for its survival,
     it will either die or decay.  So, it is very important  to  main­
     tain  constant  supply  lines for sectors and units.  Naval units
     and caravans can be used for mobile short range  supply  sources,
     but with small storage capacities, they can not be depended on as
     long term supply sites.

     Each of the supply centers will gather raw materials from  neigh­
     boring  sectors during the update, and then redistribute them, as
     needed, to those same sectors.  The range of influence of a  sup­
     ply  center  varies with the type of supply center, but is also a
     function of the national communication range.  Each supply center
     also has a weighting assigned to it, to determine what percentage
     of each sector's production it should receive.   Weights  may  be
     adjusted  by  the  player,  but must not be less than the default
     value for that supply center.  The default range and weighting of
     a supply center is given by the table below:

   Supply Center Type     Influence Range (min)    Default Weight
   ====================   ======================   ========================
   National Capital       NTN_COMM + 1.0  (3.0)    128
   City Sector            NTN_COMM        (3.0)    64 + 1 per 1,000 people
   Town Sector            NTN_COMM / 2.0  (2.0)    32 + 1 per 500 people
   Stockade               NTN_COMM / 4.0  (1.0)    10
   Cache                  0               (0.0)    0

     To  give  an  example of the weighting system: A farm sector pro­
     duces 10,000 units of food and is within  the  influence  of  the
     Capital,  1  City  of 8,000 people and a town of 750 people.  The
     weight of each, respectively, is 128, 72 [64 + 8], and 33  [32  +
     1].   The  total  weight  is  233,  and the food received by each
     should be:

       Sector           Weight         Food Received
       ============     ==========     ==========================
       Capital          128            10,000 x 128 / 233 = 5493
       City             72             10,000 x 72 / 233 = 3090
       Town             33             10,000 x 33 / 233 = 1416

     The 1 food unit lost because of integer division can  be  thought
     of as slipping through the cracks of bureaucracy.

     Now,  when a sector consumes items, the distribution of materials
     to that sector is handled by taking into account how much of  the
     required item nearby supply centers possess.  So, if a farm needs
     500 units of wood and there is one neighboring  city  with  1,000
     wood  and  another  with  4,000 units of wood, 100 would be taken
     from the first city and 400 from the second.  As  you  can  tell,
     this  is totally independent of the weighting scheme used to dis­
     tribute raw materials after production.

Economics 301: Supplying the Military

     One of the more advanced options of Conquer is that of  requiring
     that military units be supplying.  Since armies, navies, and car­
     avans can each roam well outside the national boundaries and sup­
     ply  center ranges, they must each carry what they needed to sur­
     vive.

     The food and talons (and any other items needed for survival) are
     lumped  together in one packages called a "supply".  During every
     update, each unit will consume 1 supply.  There is a limit to the
     number  of  supplies  a military unit may carry with them, so the
     units will need to constantly be resupplied in order to  continue
     their  activities.   This  will be done automatically if they are
     within range of a supply center  during  an  update.   Otherwise,
     there  are  a  number of commands, including the "region-command"
     and "command-unit" commands, which may be used to  provide  units
     with  supplies.   But,  when  resupplying  a  unit using a manual
     method, the unit must be in territory controlled by their nation,
     or the supplies cannot be transported to them.

     The  composition  of  military  supplies  varies.   For most army
     units, the supplies are composed of the monthly pay and the  food
     needed  for  survival.   For monster units, the supplies are com­
     posed of the jewels needed to bribe the creature(s).  Leaders and
     scouts,  being single man units, need not be supplied as they can
     live off the land.  Naval units need talons for payment  as  well
     as  food  for  their crew.  And finally, caravans also need to be
     given payment as well as food for their crew.

     Distribution of supplies is automated  over  land  based  connec­
     tions,  so  if a unit is on land, they may receive materials from
     any storage location which is  on  land  and  within  range.   It
     should  be  noted  that the raw materials for the supplies may be
     taken from supply centers, both the static  cities,  towns,  etc.
     and  the  mobile caravans and navies.  So, if you are planning on
     sending a troop of soldiers off into the world on their  own,  be
     sure  to  send  along  a  fully loaded caravan or navy with them.

Displaying Economic Information

     Gathering information about economic conditions is  an  essential
     part of economic management.  So, knowing how to properly use the
     Conquer display routines is very important.

     If your nation, or a portion of the nation, does not have  enough
     of  any of the raw materials, it will be necessary to designate a
     sector to produce more of whatever is needed.   In  order  to  do
     this, you will have to determine what sectors within range of the
     supply center(s) in question contain the most potential for  gen­
     erating  the  needed  materials.   There  are a few display modes
     built in to display wood, food, jewel, and  metal  potential  for
     sectors.   Also,  you  can  turn  on highlighting to indicate the
     range of supply centers.  [For more information, see Display]  If
     a  sector  is not already owned by your nation, it will be neces­
     sary to capture it before you may make use of it.  [For more  in­
     formation, see Warfare]

     Another key part of the display routines involves locating unsup­
     ported sectors.  It is possible to highlight  any  sectors  which
     are unsupported by supply centers.  This means that the sector is
     not within range of any supply centers, and thus will not receive
     supplies to sustain civilians or constructions within the sector.
     If you find such sectors within your nation, it will be necessary
     to  either  improve  the communication range of the nation, or to
     build a new supply center within range of the unsupported sector.

Paying for Sectors

     Each  of the sectors which a nation owns requires certain materi­
     als to maintain the sector and the things within the sector.   If
     the  sector  possesses  a designation or constructions, there are
     materials which will be needed to upkeep  the  constructions  and
     designation within the sector.

     The  costs  for the upkeep of a sector is computed by finding the
     base cost for the sector designation, and adding on any addition­
     al costs for constructions, modified by the designation multipli­
     er.  So, using the cost table in the Sector  Information  portion
     of  the  documentation,  a  town  sector  with a blacksmith and a
     church would cost:

           Item                                Talons   Metals    Wood
    ======================================    ======== ======== ========
    Base Cost for a Town                         1000       20      200
    5x Cost for a Blacksmith                     2000        0       40
    5x Cost for a Church                         1500        0       50

    Total Costs for Sector                       4500       20      290

     As the above calculations demonstrate, it is often the minor des­
     ignations that cost the most, since the basic functions of a town
     are mostly self-sufficient.  [For more information, see Sector]

     In addition to the material expenses for a sector, the  civilians
     living  within the sector will need to eat.  The food required is
     simple to compute:  multiply the national "Eat Ratio" by the num­
     ber of civilians within the sector.

     Costs  may  be  reduced when magical civilian powers such as "Ac­
     countant", "Metalcraft" and "Woodcraft" are obtained.  [For  more
     information, see Powers]

Economic Reports

     Since  Conquer  is a computer based game, it is capable of calcu­
     lating all of the consumption and production on either a regional
     or  national  level.   Summaries  about the costs for each supply
     center's realm of influence (or region) are available through the
     "economy-report" command.

     This command brings up a full screen summary of the economic con­
     dition within the nation.  There are three  summary  types:   the
     economic report, the resource report, and the sector totals.  The
     economic report summarizes talon consumption and intake,  includ­
     ing  an  estimate for the talon level for the next turn.  The re­
     source report lists all five resource (raw material)  types  with
     population, production, and usage figures.  And the sector totals
     report list what type of civilians live  in  which  sector  types
     within the scope of the summary.  All of these reports may be for
     a single supply center, or for the entire nation.

The Economic Report

     The economic report screen from the  "economy-report"  will  look
     similar to this:

 City: Downwind                                             Talons:      821679

 -----------+-----------   -----------+-----------

     The above example is for a city named Downwind, located at sector
     [1,3].  There are 5757 army troops within range of this city, and
     probably  others given the low army support costs.  The total in­
     tact by different sector groups is in the column on the left, and
     the  support  outtake is in the central column.  The right column
     displays the calculation of the next month's expected treasury.

     For defensive purposes, it is good to note  that  this  city  has
     plenty  of  materials  stored away and could also draft up to 693
     additional soldiers to help defend the city.

The Resource Report

     For the same city, the resource report screen looks like:

 City: Downwind                                             Talons:      821679

 -----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----------

     This screen shows a city with a solid production  network,  since
     there are civilians within range of the city producing all of the
     raw material types.  This means that it  would  be  possible  for
     this  city to survive on its own were it to be cut off from other
     supply centers within the nation.  So, checking for any  negative
     numbers  within the "net" column will indicate if a supply center
     needs to increase the production of  any  of  the  raw  materials
     within the region, or import them from another region.

The Sector Totals Report

     Finally, the sector totals report for a sector looks like:

 City: Downwind                                             Talons:      821679

 ----+----------+--------- ----+----------+---------  ----+----------+---------

     This  screen  simply  displays a summary of the sector population
     within the region based on the sector designations.  As expected,
     there are people in all four production types:  lumberyards, farm
     types (fertile), metal mines, and jewel mines.  Also, there are 3
     other  cities and the national capital within range of this city,
     so there is quite a network of cities within this nation.

Redistribution of Materials

     The best way to maintain economic stability within a nation is to
     make  sure  that  each supply center has some of each of the four
     production type sectors within its range of influence.  There are
     times, however, when this is not possible, such as when first es­
     tablishing a new supply center.  In such cases, it is often  nec­
     essary to move materials into the supply center from other supply
     centers in the area.

     There are two ways  to  move  materials  into  a  supply  center:
     transfer  them directly from a nearby supply center or place them
     in a caravan or navy and carry them there.

     Transferring directly between supply centers is  done  using  the
     "region-command"  function.  The maximum distance over which this
     is possible is determined by the campaign administrator,  but  by
     default is two sectors.  Placing a number of supply centers with­
     in range of each other makes it  possible  to  "string"  supplies
     over  long  distances from one supply center to another for free.
     The problem with this approach is that supplies may not be  moved
     over  more  than  one supply center per month, so it might take a
     long time to get supplies to or from cities farther  out  in  the
     nation.

     Transporting  materials  over  land  or  water  using caravans or
     navies provides the quickest method of  transfer,  as  long  dis­
     tances  may  sometimes  be  covered over a single turn.  However,
     this method requires materials to build the units, and  civilians
     to  crew  the  transports.  Once a supply network of caravans and
     navies is in place, though, the support costs are rather low  and
     the  speed  of  material  relocation is worth the added expenses.
     Loading and unloading of materials from caravans  and  navies  is
     accomplished using the "transfer" command or the (T)fer Cargo op­
     tion of the "command-unit" function.

The xfer screen

     The "xfer" screen used by both the  "transfer"  and  "region-com­
     mand" functions is a simple multi-column display with one storage
     site on the left and another on the right.  Using the "hjkl" keys
     items  are  transferred  between the two locations, and until the
     screen is quit, items may be freely moved between the two  sites.

     Only  those  materials  which  may be transferred between the two
     storage sites will be shown on the screen.  So  army  units  will
     not  be  shown  unless the transfer is between a naval fleet with
     warships and a sector with units or another warship fleet.  Also,
     once  raw  materials  are placed in a supply center, they are not
     able to be transferred again until the next month.   This  mecha­
     nism prevents "instant" transfer of materials between supply cen­
     ters from one end of a nation to another.

     The transfer screen shows the capacities for each  storage  loca­
     tion  and  the  current amounts in that location.  Each line also
     contains a "default transfer amount" which will be used to trans­
     fer  materials  if  only  a  portion of the materials needs to be
     transferred.

The National Information Screen

     The "nation-information" function is a good way  of  gathering  a
     summary  of  your national status.  It includes information about
     many national statistics and traits, and examining it every  turn
     and noting trends is a good way to chart national progress.  When
     using the function, the display will be similar to this:

   = Identifiers =     = Attributes =       = Abilities =       = Resources =
 Nation.....Khazadum Communication...3.4 Attack Bonus....+30 Talons....$4816663

     The above screen shows an NPC Dwarven nation named Khazadum  with
     a  ruler named Durin.  Whenever other nations encounter Khazadum,
     they will see a 'k' on their maps, since that is its nation mark.
     The  aggressiveness  of the nation indicates that its troops will
     be mostly defensive, and within their  fortifications.   The  tax
     rate is moderate, with inflation and currency levels stable.

     The  eat rate is at a good low level, but the communication range
     is a little low for a nation of this size.  The metal  craft  and
     mine ability are very low and there is no magical power potential
     within the nation.  Those are probably due to the nation not hav­
     ing  either shrines within magical sectors or metal mines.  Given
     the lack of wood as well, it is possible that there are  also  no
     lumberyards within the nation.  The last two items are potential­
     ly crippling.

     On the whole, the nation seems to be in a bit  of  trouble,  with
     most  of  the attributes being very low to average, and the metal
     and wood supplies having run out.  It will take a fair amount  of
     work to get this nation out of trouble, particularly in regard to
     the wood and metal levels.

National Attributes

     The nation information screen is used to display a number of  the
     attributes  of  a nation.  Items marked with an asterisk (*) have
     the possible values: Min, VryLow, Low, LowAvg, Avg, HghAvg, High,
     VryHgh,  and Max.  Those marked with a plus (+) are adjustable by
     the user.

     Nation+ -- The name of the nation, which may be  changed  at  any
          time.

     Nation  Mark+  -- What map character is used to represent the na­
          tion.

     Leader+ -- The name of the ruler of the nation.

     Race -- The race of the nation.  [For more information,  see  Na­
          tions]

     Alignment  --  The general moralistic leaning of the nation.  The
          possible alignments are: Good, Neutral, Evil, or Other.  On­
          ly the first three are available to active nations.

     Class -- The national class.  [For more information, see Nations]

     Aggression+ -- This indicates the type of update a computer play­
          er  will  make for the nation, if a computer update is made.
          Computer aggressiveness ranges from Static to Killer and can
          be turned off with the value Nomove.

     NPC  Status+  --  Is  the nation controlled by a player or by the
          computer?  If controlled by the computer, the status is NPC.

     Tax  Rate+  --  What level of taxes are drawn from the civilians.
          This may range between 0 and 25, but the higher the setting,
          the lower the popularity of the government.

     Charity+  --  How much of the yearly treasury is distributed back
          to the civilian population each year.  The more that is giv­
          en, the higher the popularity of the government.

     Currency* -- The strength of the national currency.

     Inflation  --  The yearly inflation, or deflation if negative, of
          the national currency.

     Communication -- The distance over which communication is  possi­
          ble.  This rate is a factor of the density of supply centers
          within a nation, and the availability of  roads  for  trans­
          portation of messages.

     Eat  Rate  --  An indication of how much food per month civilians
          will each.  The amount of food within  the  nation  and  the
          time of year will determine how much high this value is.

     Health*  --  The  average overall national health of the civilian
          population.  If this attribute is low, the  population  will
          be more susceptible to disease and famine.  Having civilians
          who are not properly supplied will lower the national health
          rate.

     Jewelcraft* -- An indicator of how adept the nation is add taking
          raw gems and turning them into jewelry.  The better the jew­
          elcraft,  the  greater  the national skill in locating addi­
          tional jewel deposits.

     Knowledge* -- A measurement of the technological level of the na­
          tion.  The greater the knowledge, the easier it is to accure
          new magical powers.

     Merc Rep* -- An indicator of the respect shown to the  nation  by
          mercenary  organizations  around  the world.  Higher respect
          means lower  enlistment  and  support  costs  for  mercenary
          troops.

     Metalcraft*  --  Akin  to Jewelcraft for metal minerals, a higher
          value means that locating new metal deposites will be  easi­
          er.

     Mine  Ability*  --  A measurement of the ability of the nation to
          remove minerals from mines.  A  higher  value  indicates  an
          easier time in locating new mineral deposits.

     Morale*  --  The  general confidence of the national military.  A
          lower morale means a higher chance  of  desertion  for  sol­
          diers.

     Popularity*  --  An indicator of how well-liked the government is
          by its civilian population.  A  higher  popularity  means  a
          lower likelyhood for rebellion.

     Reputation*  --  A measurement of how well regarded the nation is
          by other nations in the world.   A  higher  reputation  will
          mean better deals when trading with other nations.

     Spell  Pts  -- A numerical indicator for how much magical ability
          is within the nation.  This number dictates the maximum mag­
          ical potential of the national leaders and spellcasters.

     Spoilrate  --  An indicator of how quickly food will spoil within
          the nation.  The percentage value is a measurement  for  how
          much of the current supply will be decayed within the nation
          over a year.

     Terror* -- How much fear for the  national  government  does  the
          civilian  population  feel.   A higher fear rate indicates a
          lesser likelyhood of rebellion.

     Wizardcraft* -- A measurement of how adept the nation is at magi­
          cal  tasks.  The higher the wizardcraft, the higher the suc­
          cess in spell casting.

     Attack Bonus -- This number is added directly to the combat value
          of  any  of  this  nation's military units during an attack.
          [For more information, see Warfare]

     Defense Bonus -- This number is added directly to the combat val­
          ue  of  any of this nation's military units during any other
          combat situation.  [For more information, see Warfare]

     Reproduction -- This percentage represents what level  of  growth
          the  national civilian population will experience each year.
          Of course, this is compounded monthly, so returns on invest­
          ments may vary.

     Movement  -- A numerical measurement of the national movement po­
          tential.  This is a reflection of both physical  prowess  of
          the soldiers and of the ability of the military to relay or­
          ders.  [For more information, see Movement]

     Score -- A numerical measure of how many resources a nation  has.
          Factors  in  determining  the  score include: amount of land
          owned, size of the military and  civilian  populations,  and
          the  amount  of  raw materials produced and stored in supply
          centers.

     The items in the last column are simple measurements  of  various
     quantities  within the nation such as the raw materials and mili­
     tary units.
