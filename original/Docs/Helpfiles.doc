
The Documentation System

     As you might have noticed, Conquer is a rather complex game.  For
     this reason, I hope to provide a thorough documentation system.

     One of the keys to making sure that the documentation is as accu­
     rate  as possible is the fact that I use the same source files to
     generate both the online and hardcopy versions of the  documenta­
     tion.    This  assures  that  if I have gotten something wrong, I
     have at least been consistent about it.

     For those who are curious, I write the  documentation  using  the
     roff typesetting package which is available on most Unix systems.
     I developed my own set of macros which allow me to  create  auto­
     matic  paging  for both the troff (actually psroff) and the nroff
     output.  [Well, I did cheat a bit by filtering the nroff output a
     little,  but  that  was  just  to  allow the output to work in my
     pager, so you can't hold it against me.]  I only use 3  fonts  in
     the  psroff  mode:  a  fixed font for the screen examples and two
     times roman fonts for the normal text and titles.  My macros also
     have  the  nice  feature  of  keeping track of what will fit on a
     page, so that I can avoid having sections of text cut in half.

     I am always open to suggestions for  improvement,  and  that  in­
     cludes  suggestions  for  enhancing  the documentation system, or
     just ways of clarifying the text  of  the  documentation  itself.
     So, if you have any ideas you think I should hear about, concern­
     ing ANY aspect of the game, feel free to get in touch with me.

What is in each Help Section?

     This section gives a quick summary of what each of the help  sec­
     tions  contain,  so that you might be able to locate the informa­
     tion more easily.

     Helpfiles ("Conquer Documentation Sections") -- A description  of
          what  this  part of the documentation is for is given within
          the section itself.

     Overview ("A General View of Conquer") -- Read this to get a gen­
          eral idea of what Conquer is about.

     Functions  ("The  List of Commands") -- The list of Conquer func­
          tions, function descriptions and default key bindings.

     Display ("Conquer Data Display Routines") -- A description of the
          information display system.

     Sectors  ("Sector  Information") -- Descriptions of designations,
          constructions, vegetations, elevations and raw materials.

     Nations ("Racial Traits and Nation Roles") --  Information  about
          the different races and nation types.

     Economics  ("Economic  Management") -- A look at how the economic
          system of Conquer works.

     Movement ("Unit Relocation")  --  Relocating  units  from  sector
          [X1,Y1]  to  sector  [X2,Y2]  is  an important aspect of the
          game, and this section helps you learn how to do just  that.

     Warfare  ("Military Units and Combat") -- How to destroy your op­
          ponents using military means, or at least  keep  from  being
          destroyed yourself.

     Powers ("Magic Powers") -- Spell casting and magic powers play an
          important role in the realm of Conquer, and this  documenta­
          tion describes how such sorcery is done.

     Xchanges  ("Communication  Between  Players") -- Sending messages
          from one nation to another  is  much  easier  electronically
          than via horseback.

     Beginnings  ("Beginners  Hints") -- For those just starting, this
          section provides tips and hints as to how to become a better
          player,  or  at least give enough clues to allow you to sur­
          vive.

     God-Powers ("Conquer God Mode") -- A cookbook for world  creation
          and a listing of commands for ruling the world.

     Customize ("Conquer Customization Settings") -- This help section
          describes how to customize the Conquer environment.   Rebind
          keys,  create  your own displays, and have Conquer store the
          changes.

     Quickies ("Charts and Summaries") -- A summary  of  the  commands
          and concepts of Conquer which, printed, will make a nice ad­
          dition to your desk reference.

     Version ("Version Information") -- Last, but not least, there  is
          the  credits.   This  document will give a listing of people
          involved in the creation of Conquer and some of its history.

What about those other things?

     Now, if you were paying attention, as I am sure you were, you are
     wondering why I left some of the on-line help entries out.  Well,
     those help entries are used as part of the documentation, but are
     not built from preset help files.  They are generated by  Conquer
     based  on  the data in the campaign so an accurate representation
     is possible.

     The "Runtime" documentation consists of:

     Army Types -- This entry will provide  a  quick  summary  of  the
          ability  of  a  specified type of army unit.  A good deal of
          information will be provided, including  combat  information
          and  any  special  unit  abilities.  A summary of all of the
          units is also available by entering "*" as the unit type.

     Key Bindings -- This selection provides  an  interactive  way  of
          querying what function is bound to a given keystroke.

     List  of Commands -- This option provides a listing of all of the
          global level functions as well as all key bindings which are
          associated with each function.

     Tradegoods  --  Tradegoods play an important role within Conquer,
          and as such also need some quick documentation.   Tradegoods
          are  broken  into fourteen separate classes, with each class
          producing a given effect.  To get information on items with­
          in  a class, or on the tradegood class itself, specify which
          class of tradegoods you are interested in.

          The tradegood classes are: None, Popularity,  Communication,
          Fishing,  Farming,  Spoilrate,  Lumber,  Knowledge, Eatrate,
          Health, Terror, Magical, Metals, Jewels.

          The information provided  is:  class  name,  description  of
          class,  what affect a tradegood has on a sector, the list of
          tradegoods in the class.  Along with all of the  tradegoods,
          the  relative  value  of the tradegood, the chance of occur­
          rence within that class, the major  designation  and  sector
          population  necessary  to take advantage of the tradegood is
          given.

     Well, that concludes my summary of the  documentation,  hopefully
     it  has helped you sort through all of this mess.  [Of course, if
     anyone but me calls it a mess, they will have some explaining  to
     do :-)]
