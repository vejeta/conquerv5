
The Sector

     One of the most basic foundations of the world of Conquer, is the
     concept of the "sector".  A sector is the smallest unit  of  land
     area  upon which the conquer map is based.  For reference, I sup­
     pose that a sector could be thought of a being, say  100  to  250
     square miles in area, and of regular dimensions.  When troops are
     moved, they must be moved from one sector to another, with  there
     never being any "in between"; thus a specific unit may be thought
     of as residing within a specific sector.

     A sector is described as consisting of a certain type of  terrain
     (such  as  mountains or hills, etc.), and being covered by a cer­
     tain class of vegetation (such as wood, swamp, or  light  vegeta­
     tion).   In  addition  to being characterized by the general geo­
     graphical and ecological layout, each  sector  may  also  possess
     special  characteristics  (such as jewel or metal deposits) which
     can make it more desirable to the nations in the world.

     As might be expected, nations will be vying for control and  pos­
     session  of  the  sectors  within the world.  Taking control of a
     sector is accomplished by having troops within the sector,  with­
     out  any other nations claiming the sector or having their troops
     there to block the claim to the land.  Once a sector is under the
     ownership  of a nation, that nation may then build farms, cities,
     or a variety of other "designations" to which the land can be put
     to use.

Vegetation

     The  vegetation of a sector is the greatest indicator of how much
     food and wood is capable of being raised within the  sector,  and
     even  indicates  how  easily  a unit may move through the sector.
     Also, each racial class will have a  preference  towards  certain
     vegetations,  being  better  suited towards survival in such sec­
     tors.

     The complete list of the twelve vegetation types is given  below.
     The  bracketed  expression  shows the default map character, food
     production potential and wood production potential, respectively.

     barren  [`b', 4, 0] -- Such land is barely habitable, without any
          potential for wood and only a small portion of food  can  be
          harvested  from  this sector.  Elves actually find such sec­
          tors unsuitable for farming.

     desert [`.', 0, 0] -- A  desert  is  a  barren  and  inhospitable
          place, and for most nations provides nothing of value.

     forest  [`f',  4,  8]  -- A forest sector provides only a minimal
          supply of food for most nations due to the over abundance of
          trees, which cover most of the available land of the sector.

     good [`g', 9, 2] -- A sector with good vegetation  provides  more
          food producing potential than any other vegetation type, and
          also provides a small amount of wood potential.

     ice [`i', 0, 0] -- This inhospitable and harsh vegetation is  not
          for most nations, and therefore provides no food or wood re­
          sources.

     jungle [`j', 0, 10] -- This harsh temperate vegetation is  inhos­
          pitable  to most nations, but has an abundant wood supply if
          the nation can live within it to harvest it.

     light vegetation [`l', 6, 1] -- This  vegetation  indicates  land
          capable  of supporting moderate food harvests and very light
          wood harvests.

     none [`~', 0, 0] -- Only water sectors possess no vegetation.

     swamp [`"', 0, 2] -- A sector with the vegetation designation  of
          swamp is deemed uninhabitable and is therefore not useful to
          most nations.

     tundra [`,', 0, 0] -- This harsh icy vegetation is  uninhabitable
          to all nations, and provides no food or wood resources what­
          soever.

     volcano [`!', 0, 0] -- A volcano is a magnificent display of  the
          power  of  nature... creating a sector which is inaccessible
          to most everyone.

     wood [`w', 7, 4] -- A sector whose vegetation is moderately wood­
          ed.   Wood  sectors  are suited for wood or food production,
          since the land is both  fertile  and  covered  with  a  fair
          amount of trees.

     Some of the uninhabitable vegetations may become usable once cer­
     tain magical powers are obtained.   [For  more  information,  see
     Powers]

Elevation

     The terrain of a sector can play a significant role in game play.
     The difficulty of moving into a sector is a direct factor of  the
     terrain  and  vegetation of the sector.  Also, the attractiveness
     of the sector to the population is affected by the terrain of the
     sector.   And  finally, and possibly most importantly, the defen­
     sive capabilities of a sector are largely a result  of  the  ter­
     rain.

     The  are only six elevation types, which range lowest to highest:
     water, valley, clear, hill, mountain, peak.  A  more  descriptive
     list  is  given below, with the affect that terrain has upon both
     food and wood production listed within brackets next to  the  de­
     fault map symbol.

     water  [`~', 0, 0] -- The terrain in this sector is non-existent,
          being covered by water from a sea or lake.  This  sector  is
          inaccessible  to  overland  troops, but provides easy travel
          for naval or flying units.

     valley [`v', +1, +1] -- The ruggedness of this terrain has caused
          the  contour of the land to be shaped such that passage must
          take place through a valley area.  This provides ideal  land
          for  ambushes  and  fortified  defenses.   Movement  is only
          slightly hindered in such terrain.

     flat [`-', +1, 0] -- A sector with the elevation of flat  may  be
          considered  generally  level, and easy to move through, with
          little in the way of offensive or defensive enhancement.

     hill [`%', 0, 0] -- The terrain of a sector consisting  of  hills
          would  provide only minor adjustments to both attack and de­
          fense, but would be of good benefit to fortified defenses in
          such  a  region.   The movement is only slightly affected by
          this terrain.

     mountain [`^', -1, -1] -- Mountainous terrain is considered  very
          beneficial  to both fortified structures and defensive posi­
          tions.   But,  such  sectors  are  more  difficult  to  move
          through.

     peak  [`#',  -2,  -2] -- Sectors consisting of mountain peaks are
          easily accessible only to flying troops, and then  just  for
          passing  through.   It  is unlikely that a flying unit could
          survive landing upon such harsh terrain.

     Again, motion through sectors is governed by both vegetation  and
     elevation.  [For more information, see Movement]

Tradegoods

     Within  many, if not most, of the sectors of the world, there ex­
     ists a single "special" trait of the sector which  can  make  the
     sector   even  more  powerful  to  a  productive  nation.   These
     "traits", or tradegoods, provide the sector with a potential  for
     harvesting  rare  minerals,  growing rare fruits, or even for the
     finding of magical artifacts.

     There are a number of different classes of tradegoods, which each
     class  providing  a different method of harvesting the tradegood,
     as well as a different result for having such  a  tradegood  har­
     vested.

     The various tradegood classes, and the method of using the trade­
     goods within the class are:

     None -- This class is an indication that no tradegoods are within
          the sector.

     Popularity  -- These goods are harvested by farms cultivating the
          crops, or in some cases, by just  having  civilians  in  the
          sector.   Such  materials increase the popularity of the na­
          tional government.

     Communications -- Building a supply center of at least the  indi­
          cated level provides the nation with the ability to make use
          of the communication method within the sector.  Such methods
          improve  the  communication  range of both the supply center
          and the nation.

     Fishing -- Building a fishing "Farm" within the sector gives  the
          nation  the  ability  to harvest fish from nearby water sec­
          tors.  Thus, fishing provides increased food production  for
          the sector.

     Farming -- The tools necessary to increase farming production are
          available within the sector.  They provide added  food  pro­
          duction  potential  and  increase the farming ability of the
          nation.

     Spoilrate -- Building a supply center  within  a  sector  with  a
          tradegood  of  this  class  decreases the rate at which food
          will spoil within that sector.

     Lumber -- A sector with added wood potential may be harvested us­
          ing lumberyards.

     Knowledge  --  Towns  and  Cities with such tradegoods add to the
          wealth of knowledge in the nation.

     Eat Rate -- Farm sectors can be used to harvest such valuable ed­
          ibles.   Increasing  the energy value of the food intact de­
          creases the volume of food the nation needs to consume.

     Health -- Shrines and the priests within the  shrines  understand
          how  to  make  use  of the herbs for the good of the nation.
          Using such tradegoods increases the  health  of  the  nation
          population.

     Terror -- Cities with such items increase the terror and fear the
          populace feels towards their government.

     Magical -- Shrines built around such magical items  increase  the
          spell casting ability of the nation.

     Metals  --  Metal mines are used to gather such raw resources and
          provide metal ore for the nation.

     Jewels -- Jewel mines dig the valuable minerals from  the  earth,
          providing jewels for the nation.

     A minimum number of civilians must occupy a sector for the trade­
     good to be "harvested", and sometimes conditions must be met  be­
     fore  a tradegood is visible to a nation.  The next section lists
     the tradegoods grouped by type.  [For more information, see  Eco­

     needed, and rarity of the various tradegoods is available in  the
     online documentation.  [For more information, see Tradegoods]

What are designations?

     Once  a  nation  owns a sector, that nation may use it to produce
     various goods and  resources,  or  to  construct  fortifications,
     bridges,  or even canals.  The terrain and vegetation of a sector
     would be a key factor in deciding how each sector should  be  put
     to use.  When a use for a sector has been determined, that sector
     is given a "designation" which will then indicate what the people
     in the sector are to do for a living.

     In  order to make the most use of a sector, there are two classes
     of designations:  major and minor.  The major designations may be
     thought  of as the "dedicated use" for the sector; the minor des­
     ignations may be thought of as the secondary constructions placed
     within the sector to contribute to the major function of the sec­
     tor.  Some examples of major designations are:  farms, mines, and
     cities.   Some  examples  of minor designations are:  roads, gra­
     naries, and churches.

     It should be noted that the civilians of a nation will move in or
     out  of  a  sector  based on what the major or minor designations
     are.  [After all, would you want to work in an iron mine?]

The Major Designations

     As noted before, major designations may  be  thought  of  as  the
     "use"  to  which  the sector is put.  Including "none", there are
     sixteen major designations:

     farm [`F'] -- A farm sector is dedicated to growing food, but  is
          only  in the beginning stages of crop production.  Farm sec­
          tors become  fertile  only  during  the  transition  between
          spring and summer.

     fertile  [`F']  --  A fertile sector is a farm sector whose crops
          are starting to be productive.  A fertile sector will become
          fruitful when the summer changes to fall.

     fruitful  [`F']  -- A fruitful farm sector is one whose crops are
          available for harvest.  Only fertile  can  become  fruitful.
          Once  fall  turns to winter, fruitful sectors will revert to
          farms.

     metal mine [`m'] -- Metals such as iron and bronze are  dug  from
          the  ground in metal mines.  Only sectors containing discov­
          ered metal deposits may become metal mines.

     jewel mine [`$'] -- A jewel mine is much like a metal  mine,  but
          the  deposits  to be mined are precious metals and gems, not
          metals.

     lumberyard [`:'] -- The last production designation is  the  lum­
          beryard.   This sector supplies wood to neighboring sectors.

     shrine [`@'] -- A shrine sector can be a focus for magical  ener­
          gy.   National spell casting powers will increase if shrines
          posses magical tradegoods.  Resting leaders in  shrines  in­
          creases  recuperative powers and spell casting from within a
          shrine is much easier than elsewhere.

     bridge [`['] -- A bridge sector is useful to get  troops  over  a
          water sector which is separating two land sectors.

     canal  [`=']  --  A canal sector is used to create a waterway be­
          tween two land separated water sectors.

     wall [`|'] -- Walls were one of the great achievements of the Ro­
          mans.   Such sectors provide added defense and prevent move­
          ment of enemy troops unless they come through unimpeded.

     cache [`&'] -- A sector with this  designation  acts  as  nothing
          more  than  a storage site for materials.  Due to the nature
          of the cache, it is not visible to other nations, acting  as
          a hidden depot.

     stockade  [`s']  -- Stockades can hold various resources, as well
          as increase the defense of troops garrisoned  within.   They
          are,  however,  not  among  the most congenial of accommoda­
          tions, and are usually only placed in sectors  which  cannot
          adequately support civilians.

     towns  [`t']  --  A  town sector makes a good living location for
          both civilians and soldiers.  While not quite possessing the
          size or capabilities of a full city, it does provide for its
          own defenses.

     cities [`c'] -- City sectors can become the backbone of your  na­
          tion,  distributing  resources  to many neighboring sectors.
          Defensive potential is excellent.

     capital [`C'] -- A capital is the headquarters of a nation's gov­
          ernment.   A  nation without a designated capital can become
          unfocused and may be susceptible to unrest.

     Economic stability depends upon good selection  of  designations.
     [For more information, see Economics]

The Cost of Designations

     In  order  to  actually  construct the designations for a sector,
     each nation must spend a certain amount of raw materials  depend­
     ing  on  which  designation is being built and what constructions
     are already within the sector.  It is important to note that  the
     raw  materials must be available in a nearby supply center.  Oth­
     erwise, the materials must be carried into the sector  via  ships
     or wagons.

     The base expenditures needed for each designation type is as fol­
     lows:

         Sector Designation           wood       metals      talons
         ----------------------     --------    --------    --------
         None                            0           0         500
         Farm                            0           0        1000
         Metal Mine                    100         200        3000
         Jewel Mine                    100         200        3000
         Lumberyard                     50         200        2000
         Shrine +                      150         500        5000

         Canal                        7500        4000       40000
         Wall                        10000        5000       35000
         Cache *                      1000        2000        2000
         Stockade *                  10000        1000       10000
         Town *                      10000       10000       10000
         City **                      5000       50000       20000
         Capital *                    1000        5000      150000

            *  - this designation takes one month to construct
            ** - this designation takes three months to construct
            +  - 1000 jewels are also needed to build a shrine

          Sectors may not be designated as Fertile or Fruitful, so
            there is no listing for either of these sector types.

     It might be noted that with the construction of a city,  most  of
     the  construction costs deal with the building up of the fortifi­
     cations to more solid metal constructions, and the added  expense
     of  increased  city  government.  With the Capital, almost all of
     the expenses are for the relocation of the national government.

Designation Support Costs

     It would be nice if sectors, once built did not need  any  upkeep
     in  order  to survive, but in life things are never so easy.  So,
     each turn, some raw materials will have to be  allocated  towards
     upkeep.   The  amount of the needed upkeep is greatly affected by
     the type of designation within the sector.

     The chart below indicates the cost per turn for each  designation
     type  in  metals, wood, and talons.  Also listed is the construc­
     tion multiplier, which indicates how many times the normal  price
     a  minor  designation  (see  the next section) will cost for that
     particular designation.

         +   = 10 jewels are also needed to support shrines

     In addition to all of the above support costs, there is also  the
     matter  of  food.   For every person in a sector there must be at
     approximately 1 food unit per person per turn, or starvation will
     begin.  Of course, as the food supply varies, the population will
     tend to consume more or less than just  1  food  unit  per  month
     each, as indicated by the "eat rate" of the nation.

Minor Designations

     As with the real world, there are often many traits to an area of
     land which can be common even among land used for  the  most  di­
     verse  of purposes.  Thus, I have made it possible for sectors to
     have traits which are a property of the sector, but not a  desig­
     nation.   Since  many  of these traits actually were full fledged
     designations in prior versions of conquer,  I  call  them  "minor
     designations", or constructions.

     Most of the minor designations are able to be built by the nation
     itself using the command "construct".  But, some, such as "devas­
     tated",  "sieged", and "for sale" are the results of battles tak­
     ing place, or other events causing the trait to be present within
     that sector.  The full list and description of the minor designa­
     tions are:

     devastated -- Damage to the land and buildings on the sector  has
          caused  it  to  be greatly reduced in production ability and
          use.  A sector with such a trait has only a quarter  of  the
          productivity  of  a  normal  sector  of the same class.  The
          civilians also find it extremely less attractive to live in.

     for  sale  -- If the sector has been placed on the trading block,
          it is indicated by the possession of this trait.

     sieged -- When enemy armies have encamped their armies around the
          town  or  fortress within the sector, and they have success­
          fully implemented their blockade, this trait will  be  visi­
          ble.   Troops are stuck within the fortifications, civilians
          and materials will not be allowed to move either into or out
          of  the  sector,  and if the sector is a water sector, enemy
          ships will be unable to enter the sector.

     trading post -- A site for the exchanging of materials, a trading
          post  is  also conducive to business and productivity within
          the sector.

     roads -- A sector with roads within it is much easier  for  mili­
          tary  units to move through.  As a matter of fact, the move­
          ment is twice as easy with roads as without.

     blacksmith -- In a society geared around the  use  of  metals,  a
          town  blacksmith  can prove of great benefit.  When a sector
          possesses such an able body, metal  production  can  be  in­
          creased and actual consumption decreased.

     university  --  The scholarly pursuits often lead to the enhance­
          ment of the knowledge in a nation.

     church -- The backbone of many cultures, religion serves  to  in­
          crease the productivity of the masses.

     mill  --  A  site  for processing grain, a mill will increase the
          productivity of farms and extend the usefulness of the grain
          itself.

     granary  -- Used to store grain to reduce spoilage and to provide
          food for the winter months.

     fortified -- As much of the world  revolves  around  the  use  of
          force, protecting territory is often necessary for survival.
          Even the scattered farms can have some form  of  rudimentary
          protection  in place to protect soldiers and citizens alike.

     harbor -- With naval power being of great interest to many  coun­
          tries,  having  a harbor in a town or city will allow fleets
          easier landing, as well as providing less of a  hassle  when
          loading and unloading goods.

The Costs of Construction

     While  it  would be nice if things were free in this world, there
     is usually a price for everything.  And, the  minor  designations
     are no exception to the rule.  The chart below shows the expenses
     to build each minor designation.  Note that this number is multi­
     plied by the "multiplier" of the major designation of the sector.
     The added expense for the towns and cities is due to the size  of
     such  constructions within the larger towns and cities.  [Where a
     farm might have only 1 or 2 blacksmiths, a city would  have  many
     more.]

         harbor                       1000         500        3000

     And,  of course, there are support expenses to worry about.  Many
     of these expenses are just administrative costs, but most are  to
     assure  the  upkeep of the facility.  These expenses are also af­
     fected by the "multiplier".  The list of minor  designation  sup­
     port costs is:

The Use of Minor Designations

     The  minor  designations are generally of great benefit to a sec­
     tor, and the impact which the construction has is usually  depen­
     dent on the major designation of the sector.   To be most explic­
     it, if the sector is a supply center, the minor  designations  of
     the  sector  will affect materials as they are stored in, or dis­
     tributed from the supply center.  If the sector is not  a  supply
     center,  then  the  designation will affect materials as they are
     produced.  This distinction can prove crucial in helping  to  de­
     cide where and when to make constructions upon a sector.

     The  two charts below give a description of what the minor desig­
     nations are useful for in each case:

  Construction          Use within Non-Supply Centers
 ----------------      -------------------------------------------------
  devastated            productivity at 1/4, attractiveness at 1/8 normal
  for sale              no affect, a marker for a sale
  sieged                troops trapped, production down 80%, taxation down 20%
  trading post          productivity and taxability up by 5%
  roads                 sector movement cost reduced by half
  blacksmith            increase metal production by 10%
  university            production and talon income up by 3%
  church                talon income down by 5%, production up by 10%
