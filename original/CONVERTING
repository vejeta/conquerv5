Conquer now contains routines for automatically converting
old data files to the current data file format.  The method
used to insure that the conversion would work is:

    1. update (conqrun -x) using the older version of conquer.  This
       will read in all of the data in the *.exc files, which will NOT
       be converted.

    2. prevent logins until the new version and data file are in place.
       (use the "conqrun -T" option).

    3. once the new binaries are in place, you perform the
       conversion by reading and then writing the datafile.  The
       "conqrun -E" option is probably the best method to use.
        

If anything goes wrong or if you have trouble with this... please
let me know right away.

ps. If you should happen to forget to update with the old version
before you remove it, just be sure to remove all of the "*.exc" files
instead.
