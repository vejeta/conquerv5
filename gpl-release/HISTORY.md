## Relicensing Efforts (2006-2011)

### 2006 - Initial Contact with Ed Barlow
In the year 2006, someone called Vejeta contacted the authors to relicense the code and managed to contact Ed Barlow, who gave permission to relicense it.

### February 23, 2011 - Adam Bryant's Permission
[vejeta.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20081015182607/http://vejeta.no-ip.org/conquerv4/) received a message through its contact form from Adam Bryant, who had heard news of the request to release the code. He granted permission to release the code under GPL.

## Technical Notes

The original code could be extracted and assembled from the original USENET messages using specialized tools (specific tools not recalled by the maintainer).

## About the Game

Conquer is a Middle Earth multi-player strategy game that was originally distributed through USENET newsgroups in the late 1980s. The game was created by Ed Barlow and Adam Bryant and became popular in early computer gaming communities.

The game's distribution method through USENET was typical of the era, when source code was shared across newsgroups and assembled by users from multiple parts posted sequentially.

## PostScript Utilities

Martin Forssen's PostScript utilities added professional map printing capabilities to Conquer, allowing players to generate high-quality printed maps suitable for PostScript printers. 

This was particularly valuable in the era before widespread graphical user interfaces, providing a way to visualize the game state in print.

## Legacy

This historical documentation preserves the timeline of one of the early multi-player computer games and demonstrates the evolution of open source software licensing practices. The successful relicensing effort by Vejeta (2006-2011) serves as an example of how legacy software can be preserved and made available to modern audiences under open source licenses.
