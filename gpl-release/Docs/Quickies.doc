
Things to Come

     This section has yet to be written, but should appear in the next
     patch.  Please get back to me listing all of the things that  you
     feel should be listed in a "quick" summary of information.

     The  things I currently plan:  concise army listing, vegetations,
     contours, navy information,  caravan  information,  designations,
     tradegoods,  constructions,  nation  types,  racial  information,
     function summaries for all of the keymaps.
