
Basic Conquering

     Well,  to beginners, Conquer can be a rather daunting game.  But,
     once learned, it can be great fun and more than a  little  addic­
     tive.  [Don't say I didn't warn you.]

     For  those  players who are just starting, I would recommend that
     you get into a campaign with other beginners, or at  least  start
     in  a world where options are not configured too hard.  At least,
     in such a situation, there will not be too  critical  a  need  to
     learn all of the aspects of the game.

     With some beginners, there seems to be a tendency to focus all of
     your energies into building up armies and  sending  them  against
     other  nations.   While  this  can be great fun, it should be at­
     tempted with caution.  Most nations can only permanently  support
     armies  of  around  10%  of  the size of the civilian population,
     maybe twice that for short term wars; anything larger will put  a
     great  burden  on the national economy.  Also, make sure that you
     can keep your troops supplied in some manner, or they  will  just
     disappear  during the middle of the war.  Anyway, the section be­
     low entitled "Making War" will give a more comprehensive look in­
     to waging war.

Using Display Features

     The ability to see all that is going on around your nation is the
     most important thing to learn.  The longer to notice events  tak­
     ing place, the harder it becomes to respond to them.

     Because of this, the display and highlighting commands become the
     most important commands within Conquer, due to all of the  infor­
     mation which may be gathered using them.

     Probably the most useful aspect of all of the display routines is
     the ability to combine the detailed highlighting routines togeth­
     er to generate a much more informative display.  For example, you
     can immediately tell if any of your farm sectors  are  lacking  a
     granary  by  highlighting  the  top two slots using "designation:
     Farms", and the bottom two slots  using  "minor  desg:  Granary".
     Any  sector with only the top two slots highlighted needs to have
     a granary added to the sector.  There are many more just as  use­
     ful   combinations   such   as   "metal   mines/blacksmith"   and
     "owned/roads".  I am sure with a little experimentation, you  can
     build  your own sets of highlighting combinations.  [For more in­
     formation, see Display]

Moving Units

     Learning how to relocate units around the map quickly and  easily
     is a very important aspect of Conquer, especially during wartime.
     There are a number of tools within Conquer to make  this  process
     much easier.  [For more information, see Movement]

     Using  the  display  options of "Army Movement", "Navy Movement",
     and "Flight Movement" you  can  determine  how  expensive  moving
     through  the  various  sectors will be.  It is important to first
     determine a destination for movement, and then to figure  out  an
     ideal  path.   Since  the  movement mode also contains all of the
     display and highlighting options, be sure to switch between  them
     at  need,  so  that  you may better find out how to relocate your
     unit.

Taking Land

     Once you know how to relocate units around the board, you may use
     them  to claim land for your nation.  Only army units may capture
     a sector, so don't bother even trying it with your navy or  cara­
     van units.  Also, the only sectors which may be claimed are those
     which are currently unowned, or those which are owned by a nation
     you are at war with.

     To  take  land, you leave your army in a sector at the end of the
     turn, and place the army on "Attack".  The attack status is need­
     ed  because  capturing land is an aggressive action and might re­
     quire military conflict.  This also means that you need not  take
     land  if  you  do  not wish to.  [In prior versions, units moving
     across the map would leave a trail  of  captured  sectors  behind
     them, whether they wished to or not.]

     There  must  be  at least the equivalent of 75 men in the unit to
     capture a sector.  The relative capturing potential of a unit  is
     dependent  on  the unit type, so be aware of how much the unit is
     worth.  Monster units have a given size per man,  which  is  less
     than the combat strength of the unit.  Leaders are only worth one
     man when capturing a sector.  And, the other army units each have
     a capturing potential which is multiplied by the number of men in
     the unit to determine the actual capturing strength.

     If there are enemy units within the sector, left over from a pri­
     or  battle, you will have to have a significant numerical superi­
     ority to force your claim.  And if there are already civilians in
     the  sector,  you will need additional men in the sector in order
     to subdue the population.  So, you should figure  around  75  men
     plus 10% to 30% of the number of civilians in the sector.  Final­
     ly, if the sector is a supply center, you will  need  to  totally
     eliminate  all  fortified  troops  from the sector before you may
     claim it.

Top Ten First Steps

     Probably the most difficult aspect of Conquer to manage  is  get­
     ting  your nation and its economy stabilized in the first few up­
     dates.  Thus, I will describe the steps I use to get a nation  up
     and running:

         1. Put your national leader (unit 1) on Reserve.
         2. Move minor leaders out in all directions about
            five to ten sectors away from the capital.
         3. Locate lumber, jewel, and metal rich sectors.
         4. Locate high (>= 8) food value sectors.
         5. Move 75+ men Attacking units into desirable sectors.
         6. Enlist five to ten scouts.
         7. Assign proper designations to already owned sectors.
         8. Build minor designations where needed.
         9. Check for any other sectors which might be useful to take.
        10. Reinforce the capital with any extra troops.

     The  initial  focus  should be on building up the economy so that
     your nation will not run out of any resources.  Food  and  talons
     are  usually  not  too  hard  to come by, but metals and wood can
     quickly become scarce.  Thus, you should be looking for any metal
     and  wood  sectors you can find.  Either find one good (5 or more
     value) or a bunch of smaller ones combined for each of those  ma­
     terials.  Jewel mines can also come in handy within a few months.
     For every metal or jewel mine within your nation, the more likely
     it  will be that other metal or jewel deposits will be discovered
     elsewhere in the nation, even in sectors which appeared empty be­
     fore.

     By  the  third  turn you should have the following all taken care
     of: all of the materials should be showing a net production;  all
     of  the high food sectors (8 or higher) within range of the capi­
     tal should be in use; the minor leaders should be back  into  the
     nation  proper  to  avoid danger and the scouts should now be out
     and doing all of the scouting; likely town sectors about 2  to  3
     sectors away from the capital should be filling with civilians.

     Within a year, a solid economy should be developed, and more than
     one town should have been built.  By the end of the second  year,
     you should have multiple cities along with a good network of car­
     avan routes carrying materials between your cities.  If possible,
     locate  your  cities near water so that navies can be employed to
     carry your materials.  Roads should be built up in as  many  sec­
     tors as possible.

     I believe in the slow expansion of the nation, but after you have
     played a while, you will be able to  determine  how  quickly  you
     wish  your  nation to expand.  Just make sure that you do not ex­
     pand so quickly that you strain your resources.

Gathering Magic

     In Conquer, the progression of a nation is measured by the number
     of  magical powers that nation possesses.  And, the way to obtain
     the magical powers is through the mining of jewels.

     A number of factors are involved in gaining jewels, the most  im­
     portant  being the ability of your nation to find the jewel veins
     in the first place.  Generally, your nation will have to progress
     in  its  ability  to  recognize the valuable materials around it.
     So, from the beginning your nation should be interested in taking
     ANY  sectors  containing jewel deposits within your vicinity, and
     using them to mine jewels until their  production  level  becomes
     insignificant compared with your better mines.  At such time, the
     civilians in the sector could probably be doing  better  work  if
     they  were  elsewhere.   All of these ideas can, just as well, be
     applied to the mining of metals.

     As the jewels are mined, they should be brought back to  the  na­
     tional  capital  so  that they can be used to purchase new powers
     using the "magical-info" mode.  Be sure  to  bring  talons  along
     with  the  jewels, since supply centers with large jewel deposits
     are more likely to distribute talons than other  supply  centers.

Meeting Others

     Sooner  or  later, you are bound to meet another nation.  Whether
     or not that meeting is friendly is up to you and  your  neighbor.
     I have found, though, that if a nation is capable of supporting a
     war, one will inevitably happen.  It is just a matter of  who  is
     available to pounce on in such a circumstance.

     When  first encountering another nation, you will still possess a
     diplomatic status of "Unmet" towards that nation.   You  will  be
     unable  to enter that nations territory while you are Unmet; this
     is to prevent players from attacking another nation  without  any
     warning.

     In  order to officially meet a nation, you must own land, or have
     leaders, within a certain distance (usually two) of land owned by
     that  nation.  Once met, the two nations will have their statuses
     set to neutral and whatever happens from then on is up to the two
     nations.

Making War

     Eventually,  your nation will find itself at war with another na­
     tion.  After all, the name of the game is Conquer.

     The most critical aspect of warfare is the ability to supply your
     armies.  If your supplies run out, so do the armies.  The easiest
     way to supply your troops is to keep them within supply range  of
     your supply centers (towns, cities, etc.).  If this is not possi­
     ble, you will have to use  navies  or  caravans  to  support  the
     troops.   One  important  thing to note, any unit within range of
     supply sites during the update will receive supplies automatical­
     ly,  but if you wish to supply a unit manually, they can only re­
     ceive supplies from the current sector, unless they are  on  land
     you own.

     One big hint concerning warfare:  take the war to them.  If it is
     at all possible, be aggressive in your warfare, because the  land
     used  as  the battleground can get ruined very quickly.  If it is
     your land that becomes damaged, your economy will be the  one  to
     suffer.

Some More Hints...

     The complexity of Conquer is such that it is not possible to come
     up with a sure fire method for building a better  nation,  but  I
     can provide some hints that should help beginners to compete with
     more experienced players:

     == If your navies and caravans are just carrying materials,  make
          sure that they are set to "Carry" so that their cargo is not
          removed before you wish it to be.

     == When sending navies out to explore,  be  sure  to  put  enough
          talons  and  food  on the ship so that they can be self-sus­
          taining.  Also, the status of  "Support"  will  need  to  be
          used.

     ==  Do  not take sectors outside of the range of your supply cen­
          ters, since such sectors would not be usable  by  you.   The
          highlight  of "range" will help you determine just what sec­
          tors you can safely take.

     == Do not overdraft armies.  Having  to  support  too  many  army
          units can cripple your economy.

     ==  Try to draft units with specific tasks in mind.  For example,
          faster cavalry or avian units make swift  attacking  troops,
          and  archers,  infantry  or  siege  engines are fine in gar­
          risons.

     == When attacking another nation, you should establish  a  supply
          center  whose  range  overlaps  that nation.  If this is not
          possible, the next best alternative is  to  capture  one  of
          that  nations supply centers, which is a much more difficult
          proposition.

     == Be sure to build up the defenses of your nation by  fortifying
          your  supply centers.  Be careful not to use all of your re­
          sources to build up the defenses, though, since they are ex­
          pensive to build.

     ==  When attacking a nation, you can either go right for the sup­
          ply centers or you can  take  the  surrounding  sectors  and
          starve  them  out.   If you wish to starve them out, though,
          you will need a much stronger supply  network,  even  though
          your troops can be smaller.

     == Walls can be used to slow approaching land armies.

     ==  Taking  over lizard and pirate sectors can be very rewarding.
          The lizards are rumored to possess great jewel mines and the
          metal resources of pirate nations are highly prized.

     == Mercenaries are very expensive, but are sometimes the only al­
          ternative because they supply their own weapons (meaning  no
          metals  are  needed).  Also, since mercenaries are not drawn
          from the citizens of your nation, their deaths will not mean
          the lost of any population.

     == Granaries may only be built during the spring, summer and ear­
          ly fall months.

     == Supply centers take time to build.  They can still take in and
          redistribute  supplies,  but  they  are  not  able  to draft
          troops.  So, be sure to time the  construction  so  that  it
          will not hurt your nation.

     == Most captured sectors become devastated by the claiming of the
          land, so you should be sure  to  "undevastate"  them  before
          they may be used.

     ==  Do  not  let units stray out of support range for too long or
          the unit will run out of supplies.

     == To increase the supplies of a unit, the unit must be on terri­
          tory owned by your nation.

     ==  The  diplomacy statuses of "Allied" and "Jihad" are irrevoca­
          ble.

     == Putting a sector under siege cuts off  the  supplies  to  that
          sector,  and  if it is a city, it cuts off its access to re­
          sources.  [That includes  the  ability  to  draft  mercenary
          units.]

     == It takes a better than a two to one advantage in troops in the
          area to place a sector under siege.

     == Roads increase communication rates and reduce movement  costs.

     ==  KEEP YOUR LEADERS OUT OF TROUBLE.  Your leader units are your
          most valuable.  Without your leaders to focus  your  troops,
          many  actions become much more difficult, if not impossible.
