     Discussions  and negotiations play a crucial role in the develop­
     ment of national diplomacy.  Often, it is  communication  between
     players  that forms or dismantles treaties and alliances.  Double
     dealing and straight forward honesty must be  carefully  balanced
     when  dealing  with other players, or they will be able to deter­
     mine exactly what you are up to.

     To enable communication between players, there is the  electronic
     mail  system.   Using this system, nations will receive mail mes­
     sages reporting concerning economic statuses, combat reports, and
     communications from other countries.  There are two commands pro­
     viding direct access to the mail system.  The  "read-mail"  func­
     tion  is  used to read and respond to any mail which you have re­
     ceived, and the "mail-nation" function is available to send  mail
     to other nations.

     To  help  your  nation determine when any new mail has arrived, a
     small message saying "You have Conquer Mail" will be displayed if
     Conquer  detects  that  there  is any mail which has not yet been
     read.  A similar message will be displayed if the  newspaper  has
     not  yet  been  read  or, on some machines, if there is some real
     electronic mail waiting to be read.  It is  possible  to  control
     the behavior of the last operation using the "mail-check" setting
     in the "conquer-options" function.  [For  more  information,  see
     Functions]

Reading Mail

     The mail reader provided with Conquer is similar to that found in
     normal Unix mail systems.  There is a summary listing, as well as
     a  full screen display of the current mail message.  It is possi­
     ble to select which of these two modes are used upon  startup  by
     setting  the  "header-mode"  option  within the "conquer-options"
     function.  [For more information, see Functions]

     The mail reader has its own set of keybindings and functions:

     conquer-options (`O')  --   Adjust  the  Conquer  environment  by
          changing  various options.  Use this function to adjust key­
          bindings for the mode.  [For  more  information,  see  Func­
          tions]

     reader-backward  (`b') -- Scroll the current message backward one
          page.

     reader-bottom (`>') -- Shift the view to the bottom of  the  cur­
          rent message.  This can be especially useful for viewing the
          summary at the bottom of the economic reports.

     reader-delete (`D') -- Mark the current mail  message  for  dele­
          tion.   The  deletion will not actually take place until the
          "reader-purge" or  the  "reader-exit"  functions  have  been
          used.

     reader-delete-all (`C') -- Mark all messages for deletion.  Actu­
          al deletion will take place when either  the  "reader-purge"
          or the "reader-exit" function has been used.

     reader-delete-and-next  (`d')  --  Mark  the  current message for
          deletion and go to the next undeleted message.  The  message
          will  then be removed whenever the "reader-exit" or "reader-
          purge" functions are used.

     reader-delete-and-previous (`^D') -- Mark the current message for
          deletion  and  find  the closest previous undeleted message.
          Permanent deletion will only take  place  when  a  purge  is
          done.

     reader-delete-read-mail  (`c')  --  Mark all previously read mail
          for deletion.  The messages will only be removed  after  the
          "reader-purge"  or  the  "reader-exit"  functions  have been
          used.

     reader-down-one (`^J',`^M') -- Move the current  message  forward
          one line.

     reader-exit (`q') -- Purge any mail marked for deletion, and exit
          the mail reader.

     reader-forward (`b') -- Scroll the current mail  message  forward
          one page.

     reader-goto (`G',`g') -- Go to a specified mail message.

     reader-help  (`?')  --  Display the list of mail reader functions
          and keybindings.

     reader-mail (`M',`m') -- Send a mail message to  another  nation.
          This  is  equivalent to using the "mail-nation" function de­
          scribed later.

     reader-mail-forward (`f') -- Send a copy of,  or  "forward",  the
          current  message  to  another  nation.   This will enter the
          mail-editor with the mail message already written as part of
          the message.

     reader-mail-reply  (`r')  --  Send a reply to the nation who sent
          the current mail message.  The subject line and address will
          already be properly formatted.

     reader-next  (`^N',DOWN-ARROW,`J',`N')  --  Move to the next mail
          message, regardless of the status of the next message.

     reader-next-undeleted (`j',`n') -- Move  to  the  next  undeleted
          mail message.

     reader-previous  (`^P',UP-ARROW,`K',`P')  -- Move to the previous
          mail message, regardless of the status of the previous  mes­
          sage.

     reader-previous-undeleted  (`k',`p')  -- Move to the previous un­
          deleted mail message.

     reader-purge (`x') -- Permanently remove any mail messages  which
          are marked for deletion.

     reader-quit  (`Q')  --  Exit  the  mail  reader, leaving any mail
          marked for deletion intact.

     reader-quoted-forward (`F') -- Forward the current message, quot­
          ed,  to another nation.  Quoting means that the mail message
          will have each line preceded by a sequence of characters in­
          dicating  that it has been forwarded.  This function is very
          useful for composing a message based on mail which  was  re­
          ceived from another nation.

     reader-quoted-reply  (`R')  --  Send a reply to the sender of the
          current mail message and include the original  message  text
          within the mail message.

     reader-toggle  (`H',`h')  --  Toggle  between  header, or summary
          mode, and the full screen message mode.

     reader-top (`<') -- Shift the view of the current mail message to
          the top of the current mail message.

     reader-undelete  (`u')  -- Remove a deletion marker from the cur­
          rent message, or the nearest previous  mail  message  marked
          for deletion.

     reader-unread  (`U')  --  Remove the indicator which shows that a
          mail message has already been read.   If  the  current  mail
          message  has  no such marker, the nearest previous mail mes­
          sage with one will have it removed.

     reader-up-one (`^H',DEL) -- Move the current message backward one
          line.

     redraw-screen  (`^L',`^R')  -- Clear the screen and redisplay the
          information.

     ignore-key  (`^B',`^F',LEFT-ARROW,RIGHT-ARROW)  --  Ignore  these
          keys when used.

Sending Mail

     Getting  into  the  mail  editor is done through using either the
     "mail-nation" function, or through the reply, mail or forward op­
     tions  within the mail reader.  Once the mail editor has been en­
     tered, there are a number of commands and  options  available  to
     help compose a mail message.

     The editor screen will look something like:

To:
Subject:



 Conquer Version 5.0: Mail Editor                     Hit "ESC-?" for Bindings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter a nation, "god" (to mail deity), or "news" (to send a personal)

     The first line will contain the list of nations to which the mail
     message is being sent.  Typing in a nation name on that line will
     add  it  to the list of nations who will receive the message.  It
     is not possible for two messages to be sent to the same nation at
     the  same  time, so you might receive an error message indicating
     that some other nation is already sending mail  to  that  nation.
     If you should, waiting a few minutes for the other player to fin­
     ish will take care of the problem.

     The second line is called the subject line, and is used to  indi­
     cate a summary or topic for the mail message.  A subject may only
     be one line long, so a short phrase is best.  If  no  subject  is
     provided,  the  string "[none]" will be inserted when the message
     is sent.

     The area below the subject line should be used to  enter  in  the
     text of the message.  The text can consist of anything, but send­
     ing useless mail to other nations might not be looked  on  favor­
     ably.   For  those familiar with "emacs" keybindings, the Conquer
     mail editor shouldn't pose much of a  problem.   In  the  future,
     support  for  a  "vi" mode will also be available.  Regardless of
     how you feel about the mail editor, it is possible  to  use  your
     own  editor  of  choice  to compose the message, using the "mail-
     spawn-editor" function.

     Once the mail message is complete, you may deliver it  using  the
     "mail-exit"  or  "mail-send"  functions.  If you should decide to
     abort the mail editor and  discard  everything,  simply  use  the
     "mail-quit"  function.   The next section describes the full list
     of mail editor commands, along with their default key bindings.

List of mail mode functions

     The full list of  functions  and  default  keybindings  available
     within the mail editor is:

          changing various options, including keybindings for the mail
          editor.

          happen.

     mail-backward (`^B',LEFT-ARROW) -- Move the cursor one  character
          to the left.

     mail-beginning-of-line (`^A') -- Move the cursor to the beginning

     mail-end-of-line (`^E') -- Move the cursor to the end of the cur­
          rent line.

     mail-exit  (`^X')  --  Deliver the mail message and then exit the
          mail editor.

     mail-forward (`^F',RIGHT-ARROW) -- Move the cursor one  character

          left of the cursor to the beginning of the current line.

     mail-kill-line  (`^K')  --  Delete all characters from the cursor
          until the end of the current line.

     mail-newline (`^J',`^M') -- Break the current line at the  cursor
          and create a new line of text.

          the editor.

     mail-upline (`^P',UP-ARROW) -- Move the cursor up one line.

     redraw-screen (`^L',`^R') -- Redraw the screen display.

News Postings

     The newspaper is available to all users and contains a summary of
     events  taking  place  during recent months.  A limited number of
     newspapers will be kept in storage, so reading them frequently is
     recommended.   If  the  latest  newspaper has not been read or if
     something has been added to it, a message stating that "There  is
     Conquer  News"  will  be  displayed at the bottom of the main map
     screen.  Using the "read-paper" command will display the list  of
     currently  available  newspapers,  by  date, with the most recent
     editions being listed first.

     Newspaper are divided into five sections:  headlines,  economics,
     real  estate,  warfare and personals.  The headlines section will
     contain any important information such as declarations of war and
     peace,  leader and monster recruitment and notifications when two
     nations meet.  The economics report lists any famines  or  deser­
     tions  which have taken place in the world, giving an idea of how
     well nations are being managed.  The real  estate  listings  show
     who  took  what land, and from whom.  The warfare section gives a
     run down of who was involved in the  battles  around  the  world.
     Finally, the personals section is where any mail messages sent to
     "news" will appear, so that they may be read by all of the  play­
     ers.

Economic Reports

     During  each  update, mail will be sent from the updating program
     describing events taking place within the nation.   Some  of  the
     mail  messages  will  describe the economic conditions within the
     nation and others will contain reports about battles.  [For  more
     information, see Warfare]

     The  economic reports come in two different forms: production re­
     ports and consumption reports.  The production reports will  pro­
     vide a detailed summary of how much of what materials each region
     produced.  If you see that some towns and cities are not generat­
     ing enough of their own raw materials, you might need to add more
     farms, mines, or lumberyards within the  region  to  improve  the
     situation.   The  consumption  report gives a summary of how much
     was consumed on a nationwide basis.  [For more  information,  see
     Economics]
