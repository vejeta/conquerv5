
Conquer General Description

     The  basic  play of Conquer is very similar to that of many board
     war games: players make their moves for a turn, all of the  moves
     are  summarized and conflicts resolved, and then counters are re­
     set for the next turn.  Except, with Conquer, all  of  the  moves
     are  entered using a full screen computer interface, and the com­
     puter is used to compute the results of combat and  movement.   A
     nation  is added using the "conqrun" program, specifying "conqrun
     -a" in your shell.  Once created, a nation is accessed using  the
     "conquer" program, where "conquer -n NAME" may be used to specify
     a nation to log into.

     Conquer can best be summarized as a multi-player fantasy wargame.
     The  game  is set on a world with the technological base approxi­
     mating that of the Roman civilization.  Roman numerals and  dates
     are  used  to emphasize this feeling.  But, in addition to normal
     human troops and warfare, there is the element of magic.   Spells
     can be cast to heal troops or damage enemies.  Magical beasts and
     creatures roam the world wreaking havoc.  And, nations made up of
     Dwarves,  Elves  and  Orcs compete with Humans for control of the
     world.

     Each player controls a nation composed of civilians from  one  of
     these  races.   Skill in the management of economic, magical, and
     military factors is needed for the survival of the  nation.   The
     economic  base  revolves  around  the  cities, or supply centers,
     within the nation.  These supply centers must take in  materials,
     such  as  gold talons and food, from surrounding lands and redis­
     tribute them so that get where they are needed.  Magical "powers"
     are  used  to  determine the development level of a nation.  They
     are used to determine things such as what army units  are  avail­
     able and how well a nation may survive in a certain type of vege­
     tation.  Finally, the military army, navies and caravans  can  be
     used  to  brutally  conquer  neighboring  lands, providing growth
     through conquest.

Conquer Time

     To keep perspective focused on the Roman era upon which  much  of
     Conquer's  "feel" is based, a calendar was chosen using Roman nu­
     merals and months.

     Each turn in Conquer represents a month of game play.  The calen­
     dar  used  by Conquer is a modified Julian calendar, which is re­
     lated to the modern calendar as on the chart below:

        Modern Western      Conquer (Julian)        Seasons
        ===============     =================       ==========
        March               Martius                 Spring
        April               Aprillis                Spring
        May                 Maius                   Spring
        June                Junius                  Summer
        July                Quintilis               Summer
        August              Sextilis                Summer
        September           Septembre               Fall
        October             Octobre                 Fall
        November            Novembre                Fall
        December            Decembre                Winter
        January           * Januarius               Winter
        February          * Februarius              Winter

     * While on the real Julian calendar, the  "months"  of  Januarius
     and  Februarius  did  not  really exist [as far as the Empire tax
     collectors were concerned], they have been  added  for  complete­
     ness.   Note that the year begins in the spring, and that produc­
     tion, consumption and other world happenings will vary on a  sea­
     sonal basis.

Sectors

     The  world  of  Conquer  is composed of individual pieces of land
     called "sectors".  A sector is defined by various traits:  eleva­
     tion, vegetation, raw materials, designation, constructions, pop­
     ulation, and ownership.

     The elevation and vegetation of a sector will determine how  much
     food  and  wood  potential  a sector will possess.  There are six
     types of elevations:  water, valley, flat,  hill,  mountain,  and
     peak.   There  are  twelve  types of vegetations:  none, volcano,
     desert, tundra, barren, light  vegetation,  good,  wood,  forest,
     jungle, swamp, and ice.

     Raw materials in a sector determine possible specialized uses for
     a sector.  For example, only sectors with metallic  ores  can  be
     used as Metal Mines.

     This  brings  up the concept of "designations".  When a sector is
     given a designation, this indicates what the job of any civilians
     within  the sector will be, as well as what sort of raw materials
     the sector will produce.  The are sixteen  designations  in  all:
     None,  Farm,  Fertile,  Fruitful, Metal Mine, Jewel Mine, Lumber­
     yard, Shrine, Bridge, Canal, Wall, Cache, Stockade,  Town,  City,
     and Capital.

     A  sector  may  also had additional traits, or "constructions" to
     indicate its function or status.   There  are  twelve  "construc­
     tions": devastated, for sale, sieged, trading post, roads, black­
     smith, university, church, mill, granary, fortified, and  harbor.
     [For more information, see Sectors]

     Finally,  a sector will be owned by a single nation.  The raw ma­
     terials and defensive fortifications from the sector may be  used
     by  that  nation to support military troops or civilians in other
     sectors.  The number of civilians within a  sector  dictates  the
     amount  of  raw materials which a sector produces.  [For more in­
     formation, see Economics]

The Shape of the World

     The shape of the world is that of a cylinder.  A good way to  vi­
     sualize it is as a globe, where the poles are inaccessible.  Con­
     tinuous motion towards the east or the west will  result  in  re­
     turning  to the point at which the journey began, while motion to
     the south or the north will eventually be halted when the top  or
     bottom edge of the world is reached.

     The  default  sector numbering scheme is based on a relative cen­
     tral position for each nation.  The numbers are  [x,y],  where  x
     indicates  a general east-west direction and y indicates a north-
     south direction.  At the beginning of the game,  the  capital  is
     numbered  as  [0,0]  and  a sector directly north would be [0,1].
     This "relative coordinate system" may be replaced with  a  scheme
     where [0,0] is the lower left corner of the map.

     The  entire map is formed by joining multiple sectors together to
     form a MxN  rectangular  surface.   The  sectors  may  be  either
     square, or hexagonal, depending on the choice made when the world
     was created.  The default hexagonal system, while  more  complex,
     and somewhat harder to get used to, is much more realistic and is
     the system which I recommend.  [For more  information,  see  Dis­
     play]

Getting Details

     The  skill most needed to master Conquer is that of efficient in­
     formation gathering.  When you first begin playing  Conquer,  you
     will  see  a  screen  filled with ASCII characters which, to many
     people, will seem a purely random jumble.  It will  appear  some­
     thing like this:

                         __/ -\__                          *Empr 1 x=110 p=0

  Type '?' for help                                         Year IX

     What  many  people  will  think of as a blob of characters in the
     middle of the screen is what I interpret as the visual  represen­
     tation  of  a  small Dwarven nation called Khazadum.  This nation
     has a central Capital surrounded by  three  Farming  sectors.   A
     number  of national leaders are within the Capital located at po­
     sition [0,0], where there are also 15,000 civilians, and the  na­
     tion has a treasury of 1,773,523 talons.

     The  map  is  hexagonal, and there are water sectors towards both
     the southeast and southwest of the national capital.  Most of the
     land  surrounding the capital is hills or mountains, but there is
     a small strip of five flat sectors and a  valley  to  the  north.
     The  current  "date" is Febrarius of the Year IX, and the current
     turn is 108, as indicated by the Roman numeral CVIII.

     There are numerous commands available for displaying the informa­
     tion  available to a player, and mastering those commands is very
     important for a beginning player.   [For  more  information,  see
     Display]

Racial Distinctions

     When  chosing what sort of nation you will control, you are asked
     to choose from one of the four possible races:  Orcish,  Dwarven,
     Elvish, or Human.  Each of these races has different traits, some
     of which are detrimental and some of which beneficial.   Choosing
     a  race with abilities favorable to the tactics that will be used
     is probably the best approach.  Some distinctions include: repro­
     ductive  ability,  magical ability, general hardiness and initial
     starting powers.

     Immediately after  racial  selection,  a  decision  about  nation
     "class"  will  have  to  be made.  A nation class determines what
     style of government the nation will possess.   The  selection  of
     the  class is even more important than the selection of the race,
     as it directly controls the beginning  powers  and  leader  types
     that a nation will possess.

     Interaction between nations and races will be varied based on the
     these selections.  Diplomatic relations between  two  nations  of
     the  same race will be much easier to manage than with nations of
     two distinct races.  So, with diplomatic  statuses  ranging  from
     Allied  to Jihad, it is important to know what races you may more
     easily interact with.  [For more information, see Nations]

Economic Hardships

     As Conquer has developed, the importance of  economic  management
     has  grown.   When  Conquer first came out, nations would consist
     almost entirely of armies and navies, with the winner  being  the
     nation  that could generate the most armies the fastest.  Now, it
     is still possible to control the world by purely military  means,
     but  even  the  biggest military buff will have to keep an eye on
     unit supplying and civilian food distribution.

     As of version 5.0 of Conquer, the economic basis has shifted from
     a vague concept of a "National Resource Pool" to an economy where
     the materials are stored within the cities and towns.   Goods  no
     longer  travel  instantly  from one end of a nation to the other;
     they must be transported using navies and caravans or be  relayed
     between neighboring supply centers.

     There  are  five raw materials within Conquer:  gold talons, jew­
     els, metals, food, and wood.  Each of these materials is produced
     in  sectors  of  different designations, and each is used in per­
     forming different tasks.  Most of the materials are  consumed  in
     the  building and maintainance of various items, such as bridges,
     fortifications, farms, armies, caravans and navies.   Being  able
     to  distribute  these  materials  from where they are produced to
     where they are needed can be a tricky task.  [For  more  informa­
     tion, see Economics]

Getting from Here to There

     Getting  from  Sector A to Sector B is one of the most basic con­
     cepts of Conquer.  It is often necessary to move your  armies  or
     navies  from  one  end of your nation to another, either to claim
     land not owned by you, or to respond to encroaching enemy armies.
     Transporting  raw  materials  between supply centers via caravans
     and navies, or using caravans or navies as remote supply  centers
     is also a crucial part of game play.

     Thus, the need to relocate units or even civilians is given care­
     ful attention in the documentation.  In exploration, it is proba­
     bly best to move in straight lines or zig-zags, visually covering
     more territory than otherwise.  In going between  already  estab­
     lished points, it is best to find the quickest, least treacherous
     path.  [For more information, see Movement]

Military Conflicts

     A major part of the game of Conquer revolves around conflict  be­
     tween military units, usually armies.  The army units, along with
     supporting naval and caravan units, are used in the capturing  of
     sectors  and in aggressive engagements with similar enemy forces.

     There are a large number of different army  unit  types,  ranging
     from  individual  leader  units  and spies to grouped monsters or
     specially organized legionnaires.  In all, there are over  eighty
     possible army types, each different from any of the others.  This
     variety will allow for selection of specialized units for specif­
     ic  purposes.   Just  be sure to protect leader units, since they
     act as rallying points for your troops and  also  enable  various
     forms of spell casting depending on their abilities.

     There  are  four  different  classes and three different sizes of
     ships available within Conquer.  The  classes  include  warships,
     galleys, merchants, and barges and the sizes include small, medi­
     um and large.  A naval fleet may consist of  any  combination  of
     these  vessels as long as no more than 31 of one specific type is
     present.  The size of the vessel determines the capacity for  the
     ship  and the class determines what sort of cargo may be carried.

     Finally, there are caravans, which are weak in combat but are es­
     sential for transporting raw materials over land.

     When  nations  which  are  at war both have units a sector, it is
     possible for a battle to take place.  This  battle  will  usually
     result  in  the  death of soldiers from the one, or the other, or
     both units.  And if other nations have troops within the  sector,
     it is possible for the battles to get even more complex as a gen­
     eral free for all may result.  [For more  information,  see  War­
     fare]

Hocus Pocus

     Magic  plays  an important role within the world of Conquer.  The
     most important factor being that the "technological  advancement"
     of  a nation is governed by how many "magic powers" a nation pos­
     sesses.

     There are three classes of magical  powers:  military,  civilian,
     and wizardry.  Military powers determine what army unit types are
     available to a nation, and also how  much  it  costs  to  support
     them.   Civilian powers reflect the abilities of the civilians in
     the nation, such as improved  mineral  mining  better.   Finally,
     wizardry powers govern the spell casting abilities of the nation.

     There are a number of spells available to a nation, from  healing
     to  weather manipulation.  Leaders and specialized leaders, known
     as spellcasters, must be used to cast these spells.   Each  spell
     drains  a  certain  amount  of health and magical strength from a
     caster and will not necessarily succeed every  time.   [For  more
     information, see Powers]

Communicating with Others

     There  are  a  few tools available to allow communication between
     player nations, the most important of  which  is  the  electronic
     mail  (or email) system built within Conquer.  This mechanism al­
     lows one nation to send messages to other nations and thereby  to
     engage in negotiations.

     The mail system is also used by the Conquer program itself to re­
     lay information to a nation during the updates.  This information
     will  range  from  combat  results  to economic reports.  Some of
     these reports will prove invaluable in determining what unexpect­
     ed events have taken place in your nation over the update period.
     [For more information, see Xchanges]

To Start from the Beginning

     I realize that Conquer is a complex and  somewhat  daunting  game
     for  beginners,  but it is well worth learning.  If you don't be­
     lieve me, just ask others who have tried!  I still find Conquer a
     fun  and  challenging game to play, and that is after I have been
     working at it for many years now.

     So, I have a number of tips that I give to beginners to get  them
     started, from how to focus on economics to how to respond to ene­
     my attacks.  I can't be sure that I  have  given  information  to
     cover  every  circumstance,  but  I  hope there is enough so that
     players will not get bogged down when new situations develop.

     Anyway, just be sure to read through at least the Display and Be­
     ginners  sections, so that you can understand all of the informa­
     tion which Conquer makes available to you.   [For  more  informa­
     tion, see Beginnings]

The Power of God

     In  order  to manage all that must go on in the world, there must
     be one individual designated as a "god" for Conquer.  This person
     is  responsible  for  creating  worlds, and managing updates.  If
     anything goes wrong with a nation, it is possible for the god  to
     go  in  and  fix it.  And, it is even possible for a god to grant
     boons or banes to any of the nations of the world.  Of course, if
     a  god  abuses  the power of management, it will be hard for that
     god to find enough mortals to continue playing, so  be  fair  and
     just, etc. ;-)

     Also,  if  a  your site is so large (or addicted), that many cam­
     paigns are running at once, it would be in the best interests  of
     god  to  share  the  labor with others.  To accomplish this, each
     campaign may be assigned a demi-god, who may or may not have  all
     of the powers of god, but only for that one world.  [For more in­
     formation, see God Powers]

Tayloring Conquer to Your Tastes

     Even though I would like to think that the keybindings I selected
     for  Conquer  are the best ones possible, I am sure there will be
     others who will disagree with them.  With this in  mind,  I  have
     assigned  a name to each of the functions within Conquer.  By as­
     signing a string of characters to a function, it is  possible  to
     reallign  the  default  keybindings.   [For more information, see
     Functions]

     In addition to setting keybindings, it is possible  to  customize
     other  aspects of Conquer.  All of the display characters, repre­
     senting information such as designations or vegetations,  may  be
     replaced  with other characters.  Also, there are a other options
     which control how Conquer will behave in  displaying  information
     and interacting with users.

     All  of  these options, including keybindings, may be set using a
     special customization file.  This file may be generated automati­
     cally  by  Conquer, or constructed from scratch using the list of
     accepted configuration commands.  [For more information, see Cus­
     tomize]

Summarization

     Conquer is a complex and detailed game, which, once mastered, can
     become rather addictive and very enjoyable.  So, to make it easi­
     er  for  players  to find information within the documentation, I
     have created a series of tables and summaries which are near  the
     end  of  the  documentation.  These tables will make it easier to
     determine what army units are best for what use, and should  also
     help  you  determine  which  magical  powers are best to try for.
     [For more information, see Quickies]

     Speaking of summaries, it would be hard for me to list all of the
     people  who  have been involved in the development Conquer, since
     there were so many and I am so forgetful. :-(  But, I  have  made
     some attempt at giving credit were credit is due, and this is re­
     flected in the  Version  information  within  the  documentation.
     [For more information, see Version]
