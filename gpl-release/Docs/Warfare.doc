
Warfare in Conquer

     While  the  backbone  of  a nation in Conquer is its economy, the
     survival and growth of the nation is even more dependent upon its
     military.  Because, sooner or later, a conflict involving the na­
     tion will develop and any losing side may be wiped out  of  exis­
     tence.   Thus,  it always comes down to the military skill of the
     troops and leaders which will keep a nation alive.

     There are three basic military units within conquer: the  armies,
     the  navies  and  the  caravans.  The navies and caravans provide
     mostly a supporting role  to  the  true  military  might  of  the
     armies.   The  armies  themselves  are composed of many different
     kinds of units, the three basic categories being:  leaders,  mon­
     sters, and normal units.

     Conflicts between units will occur when troops from two countries
     are in the same sector (or neighboring sectors  in  some  cases),
     and  the  diplomatic  status  of one of the nations is aggressive
     enough towards the other for any of its troops within the  sector
     to attack.

Caravans

     Caravan units provide a land based method for relocating supplies
     from one supply center to another.  Much faster than a "chain" of
     cities,  caravans  are  able  to visit a number of supply centers
     each turn.

     A caravan consists of wagons grouped in sets of  10  with  3  men
     acting  as  crew for each wagon, for a total of 30 men for a full
     complement of wagons.  The monthly supplies needed to  support  a
     caravan  consist  of  the food needed for the crew and a thousand
     talons per each set of ten wagons.

     Each caravan can carry civilians and raw materials.  Since all of
     the items are grouped together on the same caravan, the amount of
     space available for each item is governed by  the  items  already
     onboard  as well as the size of the materials to be placed on the
     caravans.  For each set of wagons the  storage  capacity  is:  50
     civilians,  50 thousand talons, 12.5 thousand jewels, 10 thousand
     metals, 5 thousand food or 6.25 thousand  wood.   Each  of  these
     maximums are obtainable if that material is the only item onboard
     the caravan.

     The movement ability of the caravans is half of the movement  po­
     tential of the nation as a whole (minimum value of 6), and can be
     increased or decreased by the speed selection of the unit.

     The combat value of caravans is governed by the number of crew on
     the caravan and the combat ability of the nation as a whole.  Due
     to the non-combat nature of caravans, they will  usually  have  a
     combat bonus penalty of 50.

Naval Units

     Navies  provide  a method for relocating civilians, armies, cara­
     vans and materials over water sectors and through canals.  A sup­
     ply network based on the use of navies can be the swiftest method
     for getting materials to various portions of  your  nation.   And
     navies  are just about the only method for getting military units
     across larger bodies of water.

     Naval units (or fleets) are composed of four different classes of
     ships:  warships,  galleys,  merchants, and barges.  Warships are
     used to carry armies and to perform combat  upon  water  sectors.
     Galleys are used to transport civilians and also have some combat
     ability.  The merchant ships are designed mostly for carrying the
     various  raw materials across the water.  Finally, the barges are
     very weak combatwise, but are the only method available for  car­
     rying caravan wagons over water sectors.

     Each ship class also comes in three different sizes: heavy, medi­
     um and light.  The light ships possess one cargo hold, the medium
     ships  two  and  the heavy three.  It is cheaper to construct the
     larger ships, and they are better able to  handle  deeper  ocean,
     but  their  speed  is not up to that other their smaller counter­
     parts.  The speed of the entire fleet is that of the slowest mem­
     ber of the fleet.  [For more information, see Movement]

     Each  ship hold is supported by 100 men acting as crew.  The sup­
     port cost for each ship hold is based on the ship type:  Warships
     need  1000  talons, Merchants need 1500 talons, Galleys need 1100
     talons and Barges need only 500  talons.   In  addition  to  this
     funding, food will need to be provided for the crew.

     Each  warship  hold is able to carry 100 men; Each galley hold is
     able to carry 100 people; Each barge hold is able to transport 20
     wagons;  And,  finally,  each  merchant hold is able to transport
     twice the materials of 10 wagons:  100k talons, 25k  jewels,  20k
     metals, 10k food and 12.5k wood.

     Naval vessels are much better equipped for land combat than cara­
     vans, due to their fortified structure, but they are  still  vul­
     nerable  to  army units.  On land, the default combat penalty for
     navies is 25.  On the ocean, however, most  army  troops  are  at
     half effectiveness and thus can be susceptible to naval attack.

Army Units

     The  army  unit  forms the basis of military strength within Con­
     quer.  They are the only units which may capture  land  and  they
     are also the only units which may prevent it from being captured.
     There are three basic kinds of army  units:   leaders,  monsters,
     and normal soldiers.

     Leaders  form  the focus of national power.  If a non-leader army
     unit is out of communications range of all national leaders, that
     unit  will  only  possess half of its potential movement ability.
     Other units are also able to "group" under leaders  so  that  the
     entire  set  of units might act as a whole.  And finally, leaders
     are the focal point for the nations magic abilities, as they  are
     the  units through which spells are cast, with special spellcast­
     ing leaders being needed to use the most  potent  spells  in  the
     game.  [For more information, see Powers]

     Monsters  are very powerful weapons because a single monster rep­
     resents many men in combat strength.  Also, in  combat,  monsters
     cannot be damaged but must be killed outright.  The "damage" they
     receive in combat merely indicates the percent  chance  of  their
     being  killed.  If they are not killed, they will be left totally
     undamaged.  When capturing land or being placed onboard  a  ship,
     the  "size" of the monster is used instead of the combat strength
     to indicate their ability / volume.  Monsters need to be paid  in
     jewels  every month, or they will desert the nation, and possibly
     turn and attack it in retaliation.

     Last, but not least, there is the normal soldier.  They form  the
     backbone of the military, due to their land capturing ability and
     variety of skills.  There are soldier types ranging from  Archers
     to  Zombies, including Catapults and Cavalry.  Each type has dif­
     ferent strengths and weaknesses;  some  possess  the  ability  of
     flight  and others are skilled at attacking enemy fortifications.
     The support costs vary between the various types,  but  generally
     each requires talons and food to be sustained.

     Anyway,  the  different  army  types  are broken into a number of
     classes, which organize similar types under  the  same  category.
     The next section describes these various army classes.

Army Classes

     There  are a number of different army classes.  These classes in­
     dicate those troops which are considered to be similar in  nature
     and  thus  can  sometimes  be upgraded to better units within the
     same class.  The descriptions for all of the army classes is:

     Leaders -- Leaders are units who act as the guiding force for the
          nation.  They inspire their troops as well as guide them.

     Casters  --  A special form of leader, these units serve a nation
          through their magical abilities.

     Monsters -- Creatures whose allegiance is often based  on  greed,
          such  units  are more deadly than many times their number in
          normal soldiers.

     Normal -- Such soldiers are only distinguished by  the  skill  of
          their training and the quality of their weaponry.

     Scouts  --  Soldiers  whose sole purpose it is to roam beyond the
          bounds of the national territory, such  units  increase  the
          amount  of  knowledge a nation possesses through their trav­
          els.

     Agents -- Civilians recruited from another nation's population to
          provide  information  about  that  nation.   To  enlist such
          units, you must attempt the enlistment in the supply centers
          of a another nation.

     Mercs  --  Soldiers for hire, these unit types have no allegiance
          except towards money.  Such units do not drain the metal  or
          recruit  resources of a nation.  The combat ability of these
          troops is independent of the nation under which they  serve.

     Cavalry  --  Soldiers  upon  horseback,  these unit types are the
          swiftest land based units.  Their  horsebound  nature  makes
          them  less useful when attacking fortifications, but fright­
          ful when fighting in the open.

     Sailors -- Soldiers born and bread for the seas, these troops are
          better suited to being aboard ships than any other.

     Orcish -- Orcish soldiers are trained in ways different from oth­
          er troops.  Their inbred fear of their leaders and  loathing
          of  their  subordinates keeps them fighting among themselves
          as well as against others.

     Archers -- Archers are troops trained in the use  of  the  latest
          technological advances: bows, arrows and possibly crossbows.
          These troops are especially useful in garrisons and  as  de­
          fensive troops, but in some cases can make excellent attack­
          ing units.

     Unique -- There are some unit types which  cannot  be  classified
          with  any  other  units.   Most specialized troops belong to
          this category.

The Army Traits

     There are a number of skills which can be possessed  by  an  army
     unit, such as being able to fly or being among the undead.  These
     traits will usually indicate a special skill of the unit, and are
     what  really  distinguish the various army types from each other.
     The list of traits and descriptions of each is:

     Ruler -- This unit is not only a national leader, but  the  chief
          among  all  of  the  leaders.  Without a Ruler a nation will
          lose focus and be unable to move most of their troops.

     Slippery -- Troops skilled in  deception  and  observation,  this
          trait  indicates  that a unit of a small enough size will be
          able to sneak by an enemy garrison without being stopped.

     Flight -- Some units are capable of self-generated flight.   Such
          units  can travel over land and even water at a greater rate
          than other units.

     Undead -- Undead units are frightful in combat, for they can take
          the  dead from the field and turn them into Zombies.  Normal
          undead soldiers can convert a single dead soldier per clash,
          while  undead  monster units can convert as many as 1/7th of
          their combat strength and undead  leaders  up  to  1/5th  of
          their experience.

     Anti-Air -- Units with this trait are sometimes able to force en­
          emy aerial troops passing overhead down from the sky and on­
          to the ground.

     Ballistics  -- Ballistic unit types are capable of launching pro­
          jectile weapons from their position towards their enemy, in­
          creasing  their effectiveness in combat from fortified posi­
          tions.

     Beachhead -- Units with this trait are  capable  of  disembarking
          from naval craft without the guidance of a leader unit.

     Assault  --  Only  assault  troops may disembark from a ship onto
          territory owned by a non-Allied nation.

     Sight -- Skill at observation and  intrigue  enables  units  with
          this  trait  to view more closely the sectors of another na­
          tion.

     Needmin -- Soldiers which must fight as a  group  will  not  have
          their full combat effectiveness unless they possess the min­
          imum number of troops necessary to  sustain  their  fighting
          style.

     Damaging -- Some units are capable of inflicting damage upon ene­
          my fortifications while attacking them.  If more than  fifty
          percent damage is inflicted upon the troops inside, the for­
          tifications might possibly be diminished.

     Arrowweak -- Some units are more susceptible to attack using bal­
          listic  weapons  than  others.  Such units will receive more
          damage than normal if they face a substantial ballistic bar­
          rage.

     Payoff  --  There  are  a number of units which must be paid when
          they are discharged from  service.   Usually  this  is  just
          "hush money", but often it is the final payment for services
          rendered.

     Coverbonus -- Specially designed units allow the increase of com­
          bat  ability  for  the  entire attacking or defending force.
          For every 300 men in such a unit, 10-20% is added to the at­
          tack bonus of the units fighting by their side.

     Disb-Always  -- This trait indicates a unit capable of being dis­
          banded in any sector, even one not owned by their nation.

     1/2-Recruits -- A unit of this type is not a fully mobilized com­
          bat unit and as such can draw twice the number of volunteers
          as a normal army type.  Thus, they only use up half  of  the
          recruiting pool available to the supply center.

     Trained  -- This unit requires special training beyond the normal
          combat training.  This means that to upgrade a troop of sol­
          diers  to  this  type of unit will cost more in training ex­
          penses.

     Fire -- A unit of type fire is impervious to fire attacks, and is
          sometimes capable of making fire based attacks of its own.

     Water -- Borne of water, such a unit is capable of walking across
          it without drowning.

     Earth -- A creature of the Earth, this being is capable  of  tun­
          neling  through  many  earthen fortifications and even under
          other constructions.

     Free-Support -- This trait indicates that a unit  type  is  self-
          sustaining  and  need  not be given any supplies in order to
          survive.

     Decays -- This trait indicates that the  unit  will  slowly  lose
          combat effectiveness as time passes.

     Spellcaster  -- This unit is capable of casting all of the spells
          in a nations' magical arsenal.  While normal leaders are on­
          ly able to use moral and healing spells.  [For more informa­
          tion, see Powers]

     Fullcaster -- This unit is capable of  weilding  the  full  spell
          casting  might  of  a  nation, otherwise a spellcasting unit
          will achieve a maximum spell point level at half of the  na­
          tional  spell  point value.  [For more information, see Pow­
          ers]

     Remote-Enlist -- Some units may be drafted from the population of
          enemy  supply centers.  To enlist them, a source of supplies
          must be near enough to provide the bribery necessary to gain
          the unit type.

     Sapper  --  A sapper unit is a unit which is capable of increased
          engineering skill, either in construction or destruction.

     Mapping -- Some units are able to record information onto the na­
          tional map, preserving a view of a sector, or perhaps making
          notes about it.

     Nodraft -- Even if the  unit  becomes  available  to  the  nation
          through  magical requirments being met, it is still not pos­
          sible to draft the  unit  directly.   Special  circumstances
          will be needed to bring the unit the realm of control of the
          nation.

Unit Information

     For every unit in the current sector, a description of  the  unit
     will  be  shown.   If there are multiple units within the sector,
     you can page through them using the "pick-next" and  "pick-previ­
     ous" commands.

           >army 205: 75 inf            >Wzrd 1 x=251 p=10
             2 m:45(>) st:Dfd             m:0 sp:- st:Rsrv

     The  above  two  descriptions are for army units.  The one on the
     left is for a normal infantry unit, while the one  on  the  right
     shows the national leader.  The first line shows the unit id num­
     ber, the type of the unit, and the experience or strength of  the
     unit.   Also,  spellcasting  units  will have the number of spell
     points left to the unit shown.  The `>' will be replaced with an­
     other character if the unit is the currently selected unit.  Usu­
     ally, a `*' will be used, but if a leader is a group leader a `+'
     sign  will  be  shown.   The  second line indicates the number of
     months worth of supplies the unit possesses (if  they  need  sup­
     plies), the percentage of unit movement ability left to the unit,
     the speed of the unit, and the status of the unit.

                         >navy 8 w4 m0 g0 b0
                           4 mv:90(<) st:Eng

     The above description is the similar entry for a naval unit.  The
     first line indicates the id number of the navy, and the number of
     each ship class in the unit.  The second line indicates the  num­
     ber  of  months worth of supplies onboard, the movement potential
     of the unit, the speed of the unit and the status  of  the  unit.
     As  with  the armies, a `*' or a `+' will replace the leading `>'
     if it is the currently selected unit, with a `+' indicating  that
     the navy is carrying some cargo.

                         >cvn 3 cw:30 wg:100
                           3 mv:50(<) st:Car

     Finally, an example description of a caravan unit is shown above.
     The first line shows the id number of the caravan, the  crew  on­
     board  the  caravan and the number of wagons in the caravan.  The
     second line indicates the supplies, remaining movement potential,
     speed and status of the unit.  A `+' or `*' will also replace the
     `>' if it is the currently selected unit, with a  `+'  indicating
     that the caravan has cargo onboard.

     While  using  god mode, instead of a `+' or a `*' to indicate the
     currently selected unit, the nation mark will be shown.  This  is
     to distinguish the units belonging to different nations from each
     other.

Unit Efficiency

     The health, or efficiency, of every unit is taken into account as
     an  integral part of that unit.  When spells are cast, the health
     of the spellcaster is taken into account, both in figuring if the
     unit  may  cast  spells  and if the unit has the strength to cast
     specific spells.  During combat, the combat bonus of the unit  is
     a  direct  reflection  of the efficiency of the unit.  And, after
     the combat or due to starvation, the health of the unit  will  be
     decreased due to the hardship involved.

     Thus, the "efficiency" of a unit, be it army, navy or caravan, is
     a reflection of how healthy a unit is.  For navies and  caravans,
     it  is also an indication of how sturdy the physical materials of
     the vessel are.  This efficiency is shown under the military  re­
     ports  as  part  of  the status of the unit and is indicated as a
     percentage.

     For most units, the efficiency will range in  value  from  0%  to
     100%,  with 100% indicating a fully functional unit.  Normal army
     units, however, may have a variable maximum efficiency.  This may
     be  lower  than  100%,  indicating inexperienced troops, or up to
     150%, indicating battle hardened veterans.  The value of the max­
     imum  efficiency of a unit, unlike the efficiency value, will not
     be directly visible to your nation, since the  "potential  combat
     efficiency" of a unit is an intangible thing.

Unit Movement

     Each  unit  possess  a certain amount of movement potential, gov­
     erned by the movement ability of the nation as a whole,  as  well
     as  the  movement  potential of the unit type involved.  In addi­
     tion, the unit may adjust its speed in order  to  move  at  will.
     When  moving  faster,  you  can move farther, but it is also more
     dangerous to do so.

     There are four basic speeds available to  a  unit:   not  moving,
     slow, medium, and fast.  If the unit is not moving, the character
     `-' is used to indicate the speed, while the characters `<', `=',
     and  `>'  represent  slow, medium, and fast, respectively.  Units
     garrisoned in wall sectors have the potential  of  relocating  to
     any  adjacent wall sectors, so they have a speed indicator of `+'
     if they are still able to move.

     Finally, there are a number of different  methods  for  moving  a
     unit.   Many  units possess the ability of flight, which is indi­
     cated by a `F' character before the speed value, or by having the
     speed  enclosed  in square brackets instead of parenthesis. Naval
     units are able to move across water, but not on land  and  normal
     caravans  and armies just move between the land sectors, avoiding
     water.  Anyway, no matter what the method used in relocating  the
     unit  between  sectors,  the command "move-unit" is used to begin
     the relocation of the unit.  [For more information, see Movement]

Supplying Units

     As  has  been mentioned before, unless the campaign is configured
     otherwise, each unit will need supplies in order to survive.   If
     the  supplies run out, so do the troops.  Most units (normal army
     units, navies and caravans) will need talons  and  food,  monster
     units will need jewels and leader units (and some scouts) can ex­
     ist without supplies.

     During each update, all units will consume 1 month worth of  sup­
     plies.  If the unit is within range of supply centers and not un­
     der siege or within the water, the unit will  automatically  have
     the  consumed supplies replenished.  Otherwise, the unit may only
     receive replenishment from within the same sector.

     It is possible to manually supply a unit using  the  "region-com­
     mand"  or  "command-unit"  functions.   In order to increase sup­
     plies, the unit must be in land owned by your nation within range
     of supply centers, or in a sector where supplies are kept.

     Currently,  units  are not able to live off of the land, so units
     must be supplied, and supplies must come from their  own  nations
     resources.  [For more information, see Economics]

Unit Statuses

     Each military unit may be assigned a task.  This task can involve
     guarding a fortified sector, attacking an enemy or even hiding in
     ambush  waiting  for unwary enemy troops to approach.  The status
     of the unit indicates the task which it has  been  assigned,  and
     the  list below shows all of the available statuses.  An asterisk
     (*) indicates a status where the unit is unable to move.

     Sortie* -- Launch a swift attack against enemy troops besieging a
          sector.  Only available to army units.

     Ambush* -- Hide out in the sector hoping to launch a surprise at­
          tack on enemy troops.  Only available to army units.

     Attack -- The basic attacking mode.  Not available to caravans.

     Engage* -- Keep your unit within a sector and  attack  any  enemy
          units approaching within one sector range.  Not available to
          caravans.

     Defend -- Have your unit patrol the terrain the sector but do not
          initiate  combat  unless  attacked.   Only available to army
          units.

     Garrison* -- Use a fortified position within the sector and  gar­
          rison the sector.  Only available to army units.

     Onboard* -- This status is given to a unit which is being carried
          in the cargo hold of a navy.  Not available to navy units.

     Siege* -- Lay siege to the fortified structure within the sector.
          This  would  require  odds  of  two to one or better against
          troops within the fortification.   Only  available  to  army
          units.

     Grouped  --  Follow the actions of a given leader.  The status of
          the leader is used as the status of the unit.   Only  avail­
          able to army units.

     Sieged*  -- This unit is trapped within the fortifications of the
          sector by enemy besieging troops.

     Reserve* -- Keep troops back within the fortifications for  later
          use.  Such troops may only be reached if any gaurding forti­
          fied troops receive 80% or more damage.  Only  available  to
          army units.

     Sweep  -- Perform an attack against any enemy troops encountered,
          but do not attempt to engage fortified troops.  Only  avail­
          able to army units.

     WorkCrew*  --  A unit with this status is engaged in the building
          of roads,  bridges,  canals  or  other  constructions.   Not
          available to caravan units.

     Traded* -- A unit with this status has been placed up for sale by
          its owner.

     Carry -- Any materials stored on the unit will not  be  available
          for  consumption  by the national economy.  Not available to
          army units.

     Lure -- Do not attempt to avoid enemy attackers, thereby attempt­
          ing to draw off more of the attacking troops.  Not available
          to army units.

     Support -- Any materials stored on the unit will be  made  avail­
          able for distribution and comsumption in the national econo­
          my.  The unit itself will only take from the goods for  sup­
          plies if the supply level is at one month worth.  Not avail­
          able to army units.

     Repair* -- The unit is undergoing repair and will not be able  to
          move until the next update.  Not available to army units.

     Onbrd Sppt* -- This is equivalent to the Onboard status, but also
          indicates that the  caravan  is  on  Support  status.   Only
          available to caravan units.

     Self Sppt -- The unit is on Support status, and will also consume
          what it is carrying when gathering its own  supplies.   This
          is  useful  to maintain naval supply levels during long voy­
          ages.  Not available to army units.

     OnbSelfSppt* -- This is equivalent to being Onboard while  having
          the Self Sppt status.

     Rover  --  An  army  unit is assigned the task of looking for new
          land to capture.  If in an unowned sector, it will  stay  in
          place,  otherwise it will move to the sector with the great­
          est perceived potential within a one  sector  radius.   This
          status forms the backbone of NPC territorial acquisition and
          is only available to army units.

Capturing Sectors

     There are two ways to claim a sector for your  nation:  taking  a
     sector  which  no one one owns or taking a sector away from a na­
     tion who you are at war with.  Only  armies  with  the  following
     statuses  may  capture  sectors: Attack, Engage, Siege, Sweep, or
     Rover.  Such army units can be made up of  monsters,  leaders  or
     normal  soldiers, but the combined capturing ability of the units
     must be at least 75 men for an attempt even to be made.

     The number of men needed to capture a sector  is  dependent  upon
     the  number  of opposing troops within the sector, as well as the
     number of civilians within the sector.

     First, if the sector is fortified and there are any troops within
     the  fortifications, the sector cannot be captured.  Thus, all of
     the garrison of a sector must be eliminated before it may be cap­
     tured.

     Second,  if  there are any opposing troops within the sector, the
     odds must be well in your favor (better than 7 to 1) for them not
     to  prevent the capturing of the land.  Once these odds have been
     reached, only a single soldier will be required to compensate for
     every opposing soldier.

     Finally,  you  will  need to subdue the population of the sector.
     This will usually require about 10% of the population of the sec­
     tor in soldiers, depending on the sector designation and the race
     of the troops.  If the sector being captured is  a  capital,  the
     required  percentage  is  tripled;  if the sector is a city it is
     doubled; for towns and stockades it is increased by 50% and other
     fortified sectors have a 20% increase.  A small racial adjustment
     will then be made to the final percentage which will then be tak­
     en from the total of the capturing troops.

     So,  if,  after  subduing the population and any opposing troops,
     there are still 75 "men" leftover, the sector becomes yours.

Results of Sector Capturing

     When a sector is taken from one nation by another, the  civilians
     within the sector are bound to suffer.  Thus, if there is a popu­
     lation within the sector, a portion of those civilians will prob­
     ably be killed or captured.  Also, the sector can be damaged just
     by having the sector forcefully taken.

     Such damage will generally be reflected by farming sectors losing
     their crops and the sector becoming devastated.  In order to rec­
     tify such devastation, the "construct" command will  have  to  be
     used  to  "Undevastate"  the  sector.  This will usually cost one
     half of what it would take to build up the sector  from  scratch.
     Alternatively,  the  designation  may be changed to another type,
     with the resulting conversion process removing any devastation.

Combat

     Combat may take place when units from one nation encounter  units
     from another nation with whom they are at war.  Only the statuses
     of Sortie, Ambush, Attack or Sweep will cause a unit to  initiate
     combat.

     In  combat, the troops of each nation are divided into up to five
     separate forces of troops:  Sweepers, Attackers, Defenders,  For­
     tified  and  Protected.   Combat is initiated by the Sweeping and
     Attacking forces which advance through each  successive  wave  of
     the  enemy  forces until the attack is either repelled or has met
     all of the enemy forces.  The Sweeping forces will stop after en­
     countering  any  Defending  forces, since they will avoid hurling
     themselves against fortifications.

     Sweeping forces will attack opposing Sweeping, Attacking and  De­
     fending forces in that order.  If they are repelled by any of the
     forces, they will not initiate attacks on of  the  other  forces.
     Attacking forces will attack Sweeping, Attacking, Defending, For­
     tified, and Protected forces, but must get through each  in  turn
     and  inflict  at least 80% damage on Fortified troops before they
     may reach the Protected troops.

     So, a conflict in a sector will be broken down into a  number  of
     separate  clashes.   During each clash the number of soldiers per
     side will be multiplied by average combat bonus of  the  soldiers
     to  determine  the  odds  of  the  battle.  A dice will be rolled
     against each side to determine how much  damage  that  side  will
     take, adjusted by the odds of the battle.

     For an even one-to-one battle, the dice roll, multiplied by twice
     (once for each side) the "Average Combat Damage" and then divided
     by  100 will give the actual combat damage which a side receives.
     With uneven odds, the "Overmatch Adjustment"  multiplied  by  the
     odds  will  be  added  to the damage of the lesser side, and sub­
     tracted from the damage of the greater side.  If  any  result  is
     less than the "Minimum Damage Limit", it will be limited to being
     the roll multiplied by the "Minimum Damage Limit".  All  four  of
     these  quantities  may be configured by world dieties.  [For more
     information, see God Powers]

     A simplied summary of each clash is: Step  1)  figure  the  odds.
     Step 2) compute the damage based on even odds. Step 3) adjust the
     damage for each side based on the odds.

Figuring Combat Bonuses

     The key to determining the combat ability of a military  unit  is
     its combat bonus, which is multiplied with the actual strength of
     the unit to compute the military prowess of the unit.  There  are
     a  number  of  factors  which come to play in figuring the combat
     bonus of a unit: the terrain of the combat,  the  status  of  the
     unit, the combat ability of the nation and the unit itself.

     Units begin with a base combat bonus of 100, and then have all of
     the various adjustments added in.  For navies on land, this  usu­
     ally means a 25 point reduction.  For caravans, a 50 point reduc­
     tion.  The rest of the adjustments are then computed by adding in
     the unit bonus, terrain bonus and national bonus.

     There  are basically two situations for a unit in combat:  a unit
     is attacking, or it is not.  If it is  attacking,  then  it  will
     usually  lose any bonuses associated with the terrain of the sec­
     tor, and all bonuses will be figured based on the offensive  com­
     bat  bonuses.   Otherwise,  it  will receive the bonus associated
     with the terrain of the sector, and all  other  bonuses  will  be
     based on the defensive combat bonuses.  If the unit is fortified,
     it will also receive the bonuses associated with  the  fortifica­
     tions.

     The  national combat bonus will also be added in.  If the unit is
     attacking the national attack bonus will be used,  otherwise  the
     national defense bonus will be used.  Of course, if the unit is a
     mercenary unit, the mercenary combat bonuses will be used instead
     of the national combat bonuses.

     Without  a  doubt,  the most important factor for determining the
     combat bonuses is the status and efficiency  of  the  unit.   The
     status  will  determine if attacking or defending bonuses will be
     used, if fortification bonuses are to be used, and it  will  also
     determine  any  additional bonuses due to the status itself.  The
     efficiency of the unit comes into play once the combat bonus  has
     been completely calculated, acting as a multiplier.

     Any  army  unit which is grouped under a leader will receive a 10
     point increase due to moral improvements, and any army unit whose
     leader  is  in  the  same sector sector, but not directly leading
     them will receive a 5 point increase for the same reasons.

     The efficiency/health of the unit will be  weighted  against  the
     combat  bonus; for every 2% of efficiency lost (or gained), 1% of
     the combat bonus will be removed (or added).  The sections  which
     follow  will  provide  the  exact numbers for each of the various
     bonus calculations.

Terrain Bonuses

     The actual terrain on which the battle takes place will  have  an
     impact into the amount of bonus a defending unit receives in com­
     bat.  So, the elevation and vegetation of the sector will  deter­
     mine the defensive bonus for the sector.

     Any  such  bonuses associated with the elevations and vegetations
     are:

            Mountain      +40             Jungle      +30
            Valley        +30             Swamp       +30
            Hill          +20             Forest      +20
                                          Wood        +10

     There are also magical bonuses for a sector, which will be gained
     whether  the  unit  is  attacking or defending.  The list of such
     bonuses is:

          Amphibian     +30 for Swamp or Jungle vegetation
          Botany        +5 for Forest vegetation or +2 for Wood
          Dervish       +20 for Desert or Ice vegetation
          Destroyer     +20 for Desert of Ice vegetation
          Earth         -10 for Water sectors, +20 for Mountains
          Marines       +20 for Water sectors
          Sailor        +10 for Water sectors
          Druidism      +20 for Forest vegetation or +10 for Wood
          Water         +5 for Swamp vegetation, +30 for Water sectors

Status Bonuses

     The status of the unit is the greatest factor for determining the
     combat  bonus of that unit.  First, it selects whether or not at­
     tack or defense bonuses will be used, and then it  determines  if
     terrain and fortification bonuses are to be used.

     Thus, each status can have an enormous impact on the combat bonus
     of the unit.  The summary of status information is as follows:

    Status       Bonus       Notes about status...
   =========    =======     ==========================================
    Sortie        +50        Attack; +50 bonus not against Sweepers.
    Ambush        +30        Attack; Gain terrain bonus if entrenched
    Attack        +20        Attack; Perform a normal attack
    Engage        +20        Attack; May attack others in 1 sector range
    Defend        +20        Defend, Terrain;
    Garrison      +30        Defend, Terrain, Fortification;
    Onboard       +30        Defend, Terrain;
    Siege         +20        Defend, Terrain;
    Sieged        -20        Defend, Terrain, Fortification;
    Reserve        +0        Defend, Terrain, Fortification, Protected;
    Sweep          +0        Attack; Avoid Fortifications
    WorkCrew      -40        Defend, Terrain;
    Traded         +0        Defend, Terrain, Fortification, Protected;
    Carry         +10        Defend, Terrain, Fortified, Protected;
    Lure          +20        Defend, Terrain, Fortified, Protected; Visible
    Support        +0        Defend, Terrain, Fortified, Protected; Supplying
    Repair        -30        Defend, Terrain, Fortified, Protected; Repairing
    Onbrd Sppt    +20        Defend, Terrain; Fortified, Protected; Supplying
    Self Sppt      +0        Defend, Terrain; Fortified, Protected; Supplying
    OnbSelfSppt   +20        Defend, Terrain; Fortified, Protected; Supplying
    Rover         +10        Attack; Automated Land Capture

     If naval units are in a land sector, they are considered to be on
     defend,  and  protected  by  any  fortifications if the sector is
     owned or allied, and thus are classified as  Protected.   Caravan
     units are treated much the same as naval units on land.  They are
     always on defend, and they are always treated as Protected.

Inflicting the Damage

     When the damage for each side has been  calculated,  this  damage
     will  then  be  inflicted  upon  all  of the units in the sector.
     Those units with a higher combat bonus than the average will  re­
     ceive less damage, while those with a lower combat bonus will re­
     ceive more.  This reflects  the  likelihood  that  better  troops
     would be less prone to damage than less capable ones.

     Once the damage appropriate for each unit has been determined, it
     will be inflicted upon the unit.  For normal soldiers, this indi­
     cates the number of percentage of soldiers in the unit which were
     killed.  With monsters and leaders, this  indicates  the  percent
     chance  that  a  monster or leader will be killed; If it survives
     that attempt, it will suffer no damage at all.

     For navies, the damage value indicates the chance for  the  ships
     being  destroyed  and  the crew onboard being killed.  While, for
     caravans, it indicates the percent of casualties  in  crew  along
     with the chance that the wagons will be destroyed.

     Anyway,  the result of all this is that something or someone will
     get hurt, it is just a matter of who and how badly.

An Example Battle

     I will give a quick overview of an example battle,  so  that  you
     can better understand the results of your own fighting.

   balkar Attacking force meets lizard Defending force
   Battle Odds = 2.1 to 1

     Attacking balkar Army Merc_Hv_Cav 203; men=1500 (210%) [390 killed]
     Attacking balkar Army Infantry 200; men=200 (120%) [92 killed]
     Attacking balkar Hero 100; str=3x100 (120%) [2 killed]
    balkar: Strength Level = 2000;  Avg Bonus = 187.5%
    balkar: Roll = 41; Avg Damage = 30%; Deaths = 484

     Defending lizard Army Infantry 214; men=870 (200%) [522 killed]
    lizard: Strength Level = 870;  Avg Bonus = 200.0%
    lizard: Roll = 49; Avg Damage = 60%; Deaths = 522


   balkar Attacking force meets lizard Fortified force
   Battle Odds = 1 to 2.3

     Attacking balkar Army Merc_Hv_Cav 203; men=1110 (210%) [765 killed]
     Attacking balkar Army Infantry 200; men=108 (120%) [108 killed]
     Attacking balkar Hero 100; str=1x100 (120%) [1 killed]
    balkar: Strength Level = 1318;  Avg Bonus = 195.8%
    balkar: Roll = 62; Avg Damage = 75%; Deaths = 874

     Fortified lizard Army Archers 215; men=1705 (350%) [664 killed]
    lizard: Strength Level = 1705;  Avg Bonus = 350.0%
    lizard: Roll = 52; Avg Damage = 39%; Deaths = 664

     In  the  above example, nation balkar has an Attacking force com­
     posed of 1500 Mercenary Heavy Cavalry, 500 Infantry and 3  Heroes
     attacking  a  lizard fortification.  The lizard forces consist of
     870 Infantry on defend and 1705 Archers on garrison.  Notice  how
     the  Mercenary  troops  have  a much higher combat bonus than the
     rest of the troops in the nation.  This is mostly due to the fact
     that  balkar  has  lower combat bonuses than the Mercenary combat
     bonuses.

     Even though the balkar Attacking force defeated  the  lizard  De­
     fending force, balkar got unlucky and lost two Heroes when losing
     only one was likely.  It is important to note that in this clash,
     even  though  the Attacking force had almost two and a half times
     the troops, the odds were much less due to the lizards  having  a
     higher average combat bonus.

     Finally,  the attacking force was virtually destroyed when it ran
     into the Fortified force within the lizard  stockade.   Not  only
     were  the  total number of troops greater, but the average combat
     bonus was significantly higher.  In this clash, the difference in
     damage  between  the  various  components  of the balkar force is
     rather obvious, with the Infantry being  totally  decimated,  and
     the Mercs receiving only 69% damage.  Overall, it looks as though
     balkar should have  avoided  this  conflict,  given  the  greater
     amount  of  damage which the forces of balkar took.  It was defi­
     nitely tactical mistake to have the troops on attack  instead  of
     sweep,  since the fortified lizard troops would not have been en­
     countered otherwise.

Recovering from Combat

     Often you will find  your  armies,  navies  or  caravans  limping
     around  damaged after a conflict or due to starvation.  When this
     happens you will have to take those units aside and heal  or  re­
     pair them.

     Armies  may be repaired in two manners: they can be given lighter
     Garrison or Reserve duty to slowly heal their wounds, or they can
     be  magically  healed  using the spellcasters of the nation.  The
     best form of physical rest is when a unit is on Reserve status in
     a supply center, which amounts to a reduced garrison status.  The
     second best is that of Garrison.  No matter what the unit status,
     the season of the year, the sector vegetation and the sector ele­
     vation will affect the amount of healing a unit will receive.

     The magical healing will be a quick and immediate  heal  for  the
     unit,  but the unit will not be able to receive the normal physi­
     cal recovery during the update.  A unit may only be  healed  once
     each month due to the magical strain.  [For more information, see
     Powers]

     Navies and caravans require that the ships and  wagons  composing
     the units be repaired.  It will take the same amount of materials
     as needed in originally building the unit,  multiplied  with  the
     percent  of  damage which the unit has received.  This rebuilding
     will take a month worth of work, with the unit being  immediately
     set  to  Repair status and the not being able to move on the next
     update.

Laying Siege to a Sector

     When it is not possible to capture a sector swiftly and decisive­
     ly through an aggressive attack, it can be beneficial to cut that
     sector off from any support it might receive from its  owner  and
     allies.  This can be done by placing the sector under siege using
     your armed forces.

     To place a sector under siege, your besieging forces will need to
     be  double the number of forces which the owner of the sector has
     within it.  If this is not possible, then the sector will not  be
     under  siege,  and free motion and commerce will still be allowed
     into and out of the sector.

     Once a sector is under siege, fortified troops within the  sector
     will be trapped inside the fortifications, and commerce with oth­
     er sectors will be halted.  Any troops outside the sector will be
     unable  to  retreat  into the fortifications, and external troops
     will be hard pressed to break the siege.   Basically,  access  to
     external  help  will  be  greatly  diminished, and even Mercenary
     units will be reluctant to help out.

The command-unit Function

     The quickest method for setting unit statuses,  speeds  and  sup­
     plies  is to use the "command-unit" function.  This function pro­
     vides access to a list of options which allows  the  manipulation
     of  the current army, navy or caravan unit.  The list of possible
     options will be displayed at the bottom of the  screen,  and  all
     valid  options will be highlighted.  To find out why an option is
     unavailable, simply select it.

     These options, which may be thought of  as  "extended  commands",
     are  usually  composed  of  the  lists of possible unit statuses,
     speed selections, or unit manipulations.  These extended commands
     will  be  the  most  used method for assigning tasks to units, so
     time should be spent learning all of them.

     The next few documentation sections will describe the various op­
     tions available for each of the army, navy and caravan types.

The Army Unit Extended Commands

     The list of extended commands for armies is:

 (?) Info, (+) Combine, (M)erge, (-) Split, (/) Split 1/2, (U)ngroup, (G)roup,
 (#) Renum, (<) Slow, (=) Norm, (>) Fast, (D)isband, (S)upply, (!) Adj Ldr,
 (A)mbush, (a)ttack, (E)ngage, (d)efend, (g)arrison, (L)ay Siege, (R)eserve,
 S(w)eep, Ro(v)er

     The first option, Info, will provide additional information about
     the current unit.  Things such as the unit strength, movement po­
     tential,  efficiency  and  supply  information will be shown in a
     compact display at the bottom of the screen.  Unit disbanding  is
     done through the Disband option, and the Supply option allows ad­
     justments to be made to the units supply level.  If an individual
     unit needs to be renumbered, the Renumber option may be used.  To
     renumber more than one unit at a time, the  "auto-army-numbering"
     function is available.

     There  are  options  available to join two units of the same type
     into a single unit.  The Combine option will  try  to  merge  the
     current  unit  and the unit following the current unit, while the
     Merge option will ask for a unit to  be  joined  to  the  current
     unit.   Separating units in two is done using the Split and Split
     1/2 options, with the first querying for number of troops  to  be
     separated  and  the second assuming that an even division will be
     made.

     Assigning or deassigning a unit to a group is possible using  the
     Group or Ungroup options.  Once in a group, units will follow the
     group leader and use the orders of the leader as their  own.   In
     combat, grouped units will gain combat bonuses from the grouping,
     so being grouped can have added advantages.  While  not  grouped,
     the  commander  of a unit may be selected using the Adjust Leader
     option.  This will come into play in a combat situation, where  a
     small  bonus  is given if the leader of a unit is within the same
     sector.

     The remaining options show any assignable statuses.  If  the  op­
     tion  is  highlighted,  it  is available to the current unit.  Be
     careful when launching a Sortie, though, since once started,  the
     unit cannot turn back from it.

The Navy Unit Extended Commands

     The list of extended commands for navies is:

 (?) Info, (+) Combine, (M)erge, (-) Split Navy, (/) Separate Types,
 (#) Renumber, (<) Slow, (=) Norm, (>) Fast, (D)isband, (S)upply,
 (R)epair, (T)fer Cargo, (a)ttack, (E)ngage, (C)arry, (L)ure, Su(p)port,
 Sel(f)Sppt

     As  with the army extended commands, the Info option provides de­
     tailed status information about the current  unit.   The  Combine
     and Merge selections are exactly like those for the army extended
     commands, as are the Disband, Supply, Renumber and various  speed
     selector options.  The Split Navy option allows the separation of
     unit, with selections made for each ship type and size.  The Sep­
     arate  Types option is available to quickly break fleets into the
     various ship types, which is very convenient for when you need to
     get  the  most  speed out of your warships, galleys, or merchants
     when they might be grouped with a slower type.

     The other options all pertain to the status  of  the  fleet,  and
     deal  with  either  support of units using supplies stored on the
     fleet, or with the attack and defend status of the  unit.   Refer
     to the list of unit statuses previously discussed in this section
     of the documentation for more information.

The Caravan Unit Extended Commands

     The list of extended commands for caravans is:

 (?) Info, (+) Combine, (M)erge, (-) Split Caravan, (/) Divide in Two,
 (#) Renumber, (<) Slow, (=) Norm, (>) Fast, (D)isband, (S)upply,
 (R)epair, (T)fer Cargo, (C)arry, (L)ure, Su(p)port, Sel(f)Sppt

     Once again, the Info, Combine, Merge, Renumber,  Disband,  Supply
     and  speed  selection options are much like those in the army and
     navy extended command sets.  Simply select the option to  perform
     the desired command.  The Split Caravan and Divide in Two options
     behave much like the division options in the army  extended  com­
     mand list, but the caravans may only be separated into sets of 10
     wagons, somewhat limiting the flexibility of unit resizing.

     The remaining status options most closely resemble  those  avail­
     able  for the navy extended commands.  Simply select a new status
     to have the caravan follow new orders.

      Unless noted below, the Value represents how much a single soldier
         of the given unit is worth when capturing a sector.

      Leader and Caster class units have starting experience values shown
         and are only worth 1 man each when capturing a sector.

      A/B ::: Combat value A and capture value B of monster units.

      A|B ::: For Needmin units, A indicates men required before a
         the appropriate combat bonus is given to the unit.

      (A)B ::: A indicates the men needed to obtain a +20 combat bonus
         to any allied troops within the combat.

      The list of traits is:  Assault=A, Anti-Air=Aa, Arrowweak=Aw,
