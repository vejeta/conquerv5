
The Magical World of Conquer

     There  are  many  forms of power within Conquer: material wealth,
     physical strength, and magic.  This portion of the  documentation
     deals  with  the  third and most complex of the three.  What many
     people call "magic" is simply some event or action which  is  be­
     yond  their  everyday  experience.   So, magical powers are often
     just a matter of relative technology or ability.  Within conquer,
     these  "magic"  abilities  are often manifested through traits or
     abilities which a nation possesses that other nations do not.  Of
     course, "true" magic powers and abilities are possible as well.

     There  are various forms of magic available to the nations of the
     world.  The most powerful, yet subtle "magics" are  the  national
     powers.   These  "magical powers" indicate how well advanced your
     nation is, both technologically and  metaphysically.   There  are
     three  classes  of such powers: Military, Civilian, and Wizardry.
     Military powers control what army units are available to the  na­
     tion,  and  how  well that nation fights.  Civilian powers govern
     how the national population responds to events and also indicates
     any  special  traits  of the nation as a whole.  And finally, the
     Wizardry powers indicate the prowess of a nations leaders towards
     the  arcane  arts: how well and what type of spells they can cast
     as well as some other truly magical traits of the nation.

     There are a number of aspects to the truly magical  powers:  Wiz­
     ardry  Powers, spell casting, and Monsters.  The wizardry powers,
     as mentioned before control what spells leaders are able to cast.
     And,  they  also  control what monsters are available to a nation
     through the various spells such as summon and sending.

The Military Powers

     The military strength of a nation is  greatly  dependent  on  the
     skill  of a nations' leaders and the training of its troops.  The
     military "powers" are a reflection of just such skills and train­
     ing.   They  also represent investments in new technology such as
     advanced armorcraft or winged mounts.

     The complete list of the military powers is:

     Archery -- Archery indicates that a nation has discovered the use
          of  bows,  and  has invested time for training in their use.
          This power allows the drafting of Archer  units,  which  are
          excellent  deterrents against aerial assaults and prove most
          efficient against a few other units such as knights.   Gain­
          ing of this power also results in a five percent increase in
          attack bonus and a ten percent increase in defensive  combat
          bonus.

     Armor  --  Skill at the design and use of armor increases the de­
          fensive combat bonus of the nation by ten percent.  A number
          of different unit types are also dependent on the possession
          of this power.

     Avian -- Time spent in the raising and training of various flying
          animals provides the nation with aerial troops.  The nation­
          al movement rate is increased by four  when  this  power  is
          gained.

     Captain  -- Better leadership and training leads to a ten percent
          increase in combat  bonuses  and  a  reduction  in  drafting
          costs.  Warrior is a prerequisite for Captain power.

     Dragon  -- Excellent ability at dealing with the creatures of the
          world makes it possible for the most  powerful  monsters  to
          help out this nation.  Orc and Ogre powers are prerequisites
          to obtaining the Dragon power.

     Equine -- The breeding and raising of horses provides the  nation
          with  a  number of new unit types.  The movement rate is in­
          creased by four when this power is gained.

     Ninja -- Elite training for scouting troops  allows  the  use  of
          more  skilled spies and scouts as well as the ability to en­
          list a few other troops for monitoring purposes.  Due to the
          study  of  advanced training techniques the overall national
          attack bonus is increased by five.

     Ogre -- Similar to Dragon power,  Ogre  power  indicates  an  in­
          creased affinity of a nation for the recruiting of monsters,
          but not of the same strength as the Dragon power.  Orc power
          is a prerequisite.

     Orc -- The last and weakest of the monster powers, Orc power pro­
          vides an orcish nation with the ability to recruit some mon­
          sters during the spring months.

     Sapper  --  Improved study of engineering and building structures
          provides insight into a nations ability to produce siege en­
          gines  and  catapults.   The  national defense bonus is also
          raised by ten through the use of such information within the
          nations own defensive maneuvers.

     Warlord  --  The strongest of the three warrior powers, excellent
          leadership ability and the intense study of military tactics
          increases  combat  bonuses  by ten and decreases overall en­
          listment costs.

     Warrior -- The first of the warrior powers, this power  adds  ten
          percent  to  the combat bonuses and decreases the enlistment
          expenses.

The Civilian Powers

     Civilian magical  "powers"  represent  knowledge  gained  by  and
     shared  among  the populace to increase the productivity of their
     lives.  Such powers indicate a population's  ability  to  survive
     within adverse environments or a similiar trait which may enhance
     their lives.

     The complete list of Civilian Powers is:

     Accountant -- The training of tax collectors in book keeping pre­
          vents the lose of much governmental resources.  This results
          in a 20% increase in the collected tax revenues.

     Amphibian -- Study of swampland and the acclimation of the  popu­
          lation to such environments allows the use of swamp and jun­
          gle sectors.

     Architect -- The training of builders and the study of  architec­
          ture decreases the material cost of building items by 20%.

     Botany -- The study of plant life increases the potential produc­
          tion for farms and lumberyards.  Farming is  a  prerequisite
          power.

     Breeder -- This power indicates a greater national focus on sexu­
          al education.  This results in a 2% increase in  the  repro­
          duction  rate  of the population, and, for some strange rea­
          son, a distraction among the soldiers,  leading  to  a  five
          percent reduction in combat ability.

     Democracy  -- This power indicates that the population is able to
          have a vote in the  goings  on  of  the  government  itself.
          Greater  communication between the soldiers and populous re­
          sults in a 2 point increase in the movement rate and  a  ten
          percent  increase in combat ability.  A one percent increase
          in the reproduction rate also results, but the greater voice
          in  things  also  leads  to larger food consumption and more
          chance of rebellion.

     Dervish -- Absorption of some non-aggressive nomads into the pop­
          ulation teaches the ability to survive within desert and ice
          sectors.

     Farming -- The study of farming and agriculture leads  to  a  20%
          increase in food production ability.

     Jeweler  --  Better  training  at  gem crafting results in higher
          quality jewels.  This means a 20% decrease in overall  jewel
          expenditures  as a result of the higher quality.  Miner is a
          prerequisite.

     Marine -- An increased training in navigational and naval studies
          results  in  more  efficient fleets.  The naval construction
          expenses are decreased by 20% and the ship  speeds  are  in­
          creased by 20%.  The power of Sailor is a prerequisite.

     Metalcraft -- The study of metallurgy leads to production of bet­
          ter quality metals and thus decreases raw metal expenditures
          by  20%.  The power of Miner is required to gain this power.

     Miner -- The study of metals and jewels in general,  as  well  as
          with  improved  training in mineral recovery leads to an in­
          crease of jewel and metal production of 20%.

     Religion -- The support by the government of  a  national  church
          provides  the  nation  with a greater focus.  The population
          reproduction rate increases by 2% and the likelihood of  re­
          volts decreases.

     Roads -- Actual governmental focus on building roadways increases
          the national communication rate and movement ability.

     Sailor -- Cultivation of a seafaring culture leads to  a  greater
          prowess with naval fleets.  The naval expenses are decreased
          by 20% and the ships speeds are increased by 20%.

     Slaver -- The use of captured civilians as laborers increases the
          amount  of population taken during military occupation.  Un­
          fortunately, the likelihood of rebellion is increased.

     Socialism -- Wealth is shared among  the  populous,  giving  them
          more  of a dependency on their government.  The reproduction
          rate is increased by 1% and socialization programs result in
          10% more in tax intact.

     Urban  --  The cultivation of cities results in a greater attrac­
          tion of the population towards such sectors.  The  reproduc­
          tion  rate  increases  by  2% and the population is more at­
          tracted to city sectors.

     Woodcraft -- The study of the  various  properties  of  wood  and
          methods of curing and pressing leads to more productive lum­
          ber use.  This results in a 20% decrease  in  wood  expendi­
          tures.   The  powers of Farming and Botany are prerequisites
          to this power.

The Wizardry Powers

     Of the three power classes, the only one which  truly  represents
     "magical" powers is that of Wizardry.  These powers are developed
     through the study of forces which are beyond the realm of  normal
     men.   A  number of these powers can alter the composition of the
     entire nation and its population, but most result in the realiza­
     tion of new spells and abilities.

     The complete list of Wizardry powers is:

     Alchemy  -- Through the combination of wizardry and chemistry the
          nation gains the ability to alter the molecular structure of
          materials.  This provides the nation with spells which allow
          the conversion of one raw material into another.  The disci­
          pline provided with Wyzard training is needed to obtain this
          power.

     Air -- The intensive study of the element of Air provides insight
          into  new  spells and creatures.  The ability to cast Flight
          is not the least of the abilities gained through this power.

     Destroyer  -- Through a combination of magical mischance and luck
          the nation gains all of the abilities of a  Dervish  nation.
          The  vegetation  near  the capital is also slowly altered to
          provide an environment more suitable to such a nation.

     Druidism -- The study of the magical potential within trees leads
          to  a number of new spells, along with some other beneficial
          results.  Wood production within the nation is increased  by
          20%  due  to  new  techniques  in tree cultivation which are
          learned.

     Earth -- Intense study of the element of Earth provides  new  in­
          sight into various aspect of soil and the earth itself.  New
          spells are gained and food production is increased by 10%.

     Fire -- Study of the element of Fire provides powerful spells for
          use in combat.

     Hidden -- Increased study of deceptive magic leads to the ability
          to mask the size of military units of the nation.  The  size
          of  armies  will  be totally unknown to most nations.  Prior
          work with Illusions is required to gain this power.

     Illusion -- The study of illusionary magic leads the nation to be
          cloaked  within a haze which makes armies and sectors harder
          to examine and view.  This, in effect,  doubles  the  uncer­
          tainty involved in such observations.

     Know  All  --  This power provides the nation with the ability to
          see all of sectors of the world.  If the power is  available
          at  all,  the  nation must first obtain the powers of Vision
          and See All.

     See All -- Concentrated study on magic to allow  the  penetration
          of  illusions  provides the nation with the ability to accu­
          rately view enemy troops and sectors, even if cloaked  magi­
          cally.   The  power  of  Vision must first be learned before
          this ability may be gained.

     Sending -- The ability to relocate an object from  one  place  to
          another  can  lead to many interesting spells.  The level of
          Wyzard and Sorcerer must first be obtained before this power
          is possible.

     Sorcerer  --  Superlative  skill  in  the magical arts leads to a
          greater understanding of much of  the  truly  magical  arts.
          Increasing  of  spell casting ability is a direct benefit of
          this power.  The knowledge gained via the Wyzard power is  a
          must to achieve this wizardry power.

     Summon  --  The  study  of magical portals and creatures of other
          planes provides the nation with the ability to  enlist  mon­
          sters in order to help the nation.  Only a nation possessing
          Wyzard and Sorcerer may gain this knowledge.

     The Void -- Unsurpassed ability in illusion provides  the  nation
          with  the ability to move troops unseen around the map.  The
          sector potentials are also hidden to other  nations,  unless
          they  possess  the  power of See All.  The power of Illusion
          and Hidden must first have been obtained for this ability to
          be possible.

     Vampire  -- Delving into the realm of necromancy gains the nation
          the ability to enlist undead troops into the military.

     Vision -- Magical clarity of vision provides the nation with  the
          ability  to penetrate any Illusionary deceptions.  Increased
          accuracy in troop estimates is an added benefit of this wiz­
          ardry power.

     Water  --  Study of the element of Water enhances national abili­
          ties regarding that element and provides  some  new  magical
          spells  and  defenses.  The ship speeds are increased by 20%
          and fleets are invulnerable to storms at sea.

     Weather -- Study of the weather provides  the  ability  to  exert
          some  influence  on it.  New spells are obtained and weather
          events are less likely to damage the nation.  The  power  of
          Wyzard is necessary to gain this ability.

     Wyzard  --  Focusing  on magic for magic's sake increases the na­
          tional ability with the sorcerous arts.  This power increas­
          es  the  spell casting potential and is a prerequisite for a
          number of other powers.

Obtaining Magical Powers

     Within conquer, jewels are the key to obtaining  magical  powers.
     Their  crystalline  structure allows them to entrap magical ener­
     gies which may be unlocked  through  various  arcane  techniques.
     Thus,  to  gain  a magical power one must sacrifice jewels within
     the capital.  And, due to the nature of magic, a  greater  amount
     must be sacrificed each time a new power is desired.

     The  interface used to view the powers you possess and obtain new
     ones is the "magic_info" command.  This  command  will  show  the
     list  of  magical  powers your nation possess, separated into the
     three different classes.  Information on each power can be viewed
     while  within the interface and you can also determine which pow­
     ers your nation does not possess and what they are as well.

     Using the various movement keys, it is possible to  move  between
     the  listed  classes  and  powers.  The current classes and power
     should be shown by highlighting, and the price in  jewels  for  a
     new power will be listed at the bottom of the display.

     The  "magic-buy" command is used to obtain a new power.  If there
     are enough jewels to purchase a power within the current class, a
     new  power  will  be given to your nation.  There are two ways in
     which a power may be purchased: randomly or by selection.  If you
     are  willing  to invest three times the number of jewels, you are
     able to purchase a power from the list of "Needed" powers.   Sim­
     ply  select  the power you wish before using the "magic-buy" com­
     mand.  Otherwise, if you are looking at the powers which you pos­
     sess,  selection  will  be  made randomly from the list of powers
     which your nation has yet to obtain.

The magic-info Mode Commands

     The complete list of commands available during  the  "magic-info"
     display  is  listed below.  The default bindings for each command
     are listed in parenthesis following the command names.

     conquer-options (`O') -- This command is similar to the  conquer-
          options  command within the main conquer display, but it al­
          lows the user to change bindings  for  the  magic-info  mode
          keymap.

     ignore-key  (`  ') -- Simply pretend that a key press did not oc­
          cur.

     magic-buy (`b',`B') -- Attempt to purchase a  new  magical  power
          within  the  current class.  If the list of needed powers is
          being shown, that specific power will be  purchased,  other­
          wise a random power will be given.

     magic-delete  (`d',`D') -- Give back the currently selected magi­
          cal power in exchange for half of the current purchase price
          in jewels.

     magic-down (`j',`J') -- Move to the magic power immediately below
          the currently selected one.

     magic-exit (`q',`Q') -- Leave the magic-info mode display.

     magic-help (`?') -- Provide the list of commands available within
          the magic-info mode.

     magic-info  (`i',`I')  -- Provide information about the currently
          selected magical power.

     magic-left (`h',`H') -- Move to the nearest magic  power  to  the
          left.

     magic-right  (`l',`L')  -- Move to towards the magic power to the
          right.

     magic-switch (`TAB') -- Switch between the magical classes.

     magic-toggle (`t',`T') -- Toggle between viewing the powers  cur­
          rently  possessed  by  the  nation  and the powers which are
          needed by the nation.

     magic-up (`k',`K') -- Move to the magic power directly above  the
          currently selected power.

     redraw-screen (`^R',`^L') -- Clear and then redraw the screen.

Spell Casting

     The  most  dramatic form magic can take within conquer is that of
     spell casting.  Spell casting is when a national leader or  other
     spell  casting  unit  takes  some of the magical energy which has
     been accumulated and uses it to alter reality.

     There are a number of different spells which are available  to  a
     nation,  depending  on  the Wizardry Powers the nation possesses.
     There is also a cost for casting each spell, in both spell points
     and  the  health of the leader unit.  If the leader does not pos­
     sess enough of both, the spell may not be cast.

     Each nation has a certain spell point potential.  That  potential
     is  governed  by the number of Wizardry Powers a nation possesses
     and by the magical potential within the shrines  which  a  nation
     has  set  up.   Minor  leaders  will  be able to accumulate spell
     points up to only a quarter of the potential magical power within
     the nation, and rulers only half.  Spellcasters will also possess
     half of the  national  magic  potential,  and  fully  experienced
     spellcasters  will  be able to utilize the full magical potential
     of the nation.  Regaining of spell points is at a pace of one per
     month, but if a unit is resting within a shrine, the pace is dra­
     matically increased based on the magical power of the shrine.

     There are a number of different spells which are available,  with
     certain powers needed to gain their use.  There are also a number
     of different styles of spells.  Some spells may be used for  com­
     bat,  some to magically adjust an army unit, and still others may
     change the scope of the sector itself.

     So, in order to cast a spell, you select a leader  who  possesses
     spell points (using the "pick-previous" and "pick-next" commands)
     and then you use the "cast-spells"  command.   The  next  section
     provides a list of the current spells and there costs.

The List of Spells

     Currently,  there are only a few spells available within conquer,
     but that will change, very soon, as I implement new spells.   The
     descriptions for each of the spells is:

     Enhance -- This spell will enhance by 30% the combat bonus of any
          selected military unit for any  combat  during  the  current
          month.   It  takes  5% of health from the caster and costs 1
          spell point for every 300 men. There is 95% chance  of  suc­
          cess in casting.

     Flight  -- Enable the ability of flight, for one turn, within any
          army unit.  The cost is 1 spell point per 100 men and  costs
          10  health  points  to cast.  The success rate is 80%.  [Re­
          quirement: Air]

     Heal -- Increase the health / efficiency of an army unit  of  100
          men by 25%.  It costs 1 spell point and 3 health points.

     Quake  --  Cause  an  earthquake to take place within the current
          sector.  This spell costs 25 points and 80 health has a suc­
          cess rate of 50%.  [Requirements: Wyzard, Sorcerer, Earth]

     Sending  --  Summon  and  send a monster against an enemy nation.
          This spell takes 30 health points and a minimum of  2  spell
          points.   There is a 75% success rate.  [Requirements:  Sum­
          mon, Sending]

     Scare -- Attempt to frighten the civilians of a  population  from
          the current sector.  The spell costs 10 spell points and 10%
          health and has a 85% success  rate.   [Requirements:   Illu­
          sion]

     Summon  --  Summon a monster from another plane to work with your
          nation.  The spell costs 20% health and a minimum of 1 spell
          point.  The success rate is 85%.  [Requirements:  Summon]

     Teleport  --  Instantly  transport  an army unit from the current
          sector into another sector.  The cost is 1 spell  point  for
          20  men  for every 1 sectors distance along with 50% health.
          The spell has a 65% success rate.  [Requirements:  Sending]

     Transfer -- This spell is a very simple spell  which  shifts  the
          spell  casting  potential  of  one leader into another.  The
          costs is simply 10% health.  This spell has  a  99%  success
          rate.

Shrines

     Shrines  can  become a great focal point for magical within a na­
     tion.  This is due to the fact that magical power is concentrated
     around shrines to such an extend that spell casting is often much
     easier in their vicinity.

     If a unit capable of casting spells is  within  a  shrine  sector
     during  the  update,  the  magical power of that unit will be re­
     gained at double the normal rate.  If the shrine sector also con­
     tains  a  magical  tradegood, the spell casting power of the unit
     will increase an additional point per turn for every turn  during
     which  they are within the shrine sector.  Of course, the maximum
     spell casting level for the unit will  not  be  affected  by  the
     shrine.

     Shrines  will  also  provide  additional  power  and support when
     spells are cast within their sector.  There is a 2 percent reduc­
     tion  in  spell  point  cost  and a 4 percent reduction in health
     draining for every magical point of the shrine sector.   Even  if
     there  are no magical tradegoods within the shrine, the 2% and 4%
     base reductions will be granted.

     Thus, when the magic starts flying, shrines can become the  focus
     for all of the spell activity taking place.

Monster Summoning

     Once  a  nation gains the Wizardry Power of Summon, they are able
     to incorporate monsters into their  nation.   Monsters  are  much
     different from normal army troops, because every monster is worth
     much more than a single soldier.  Also, the damage a monster  re­
     ceives  in combat will indicate the percent chance of the monster
     receiving a fatal hit during the combat.  If the monster does not
     die, the monster is unaffected by the fighting.

     There are a few ways of obtaining monsters.  They can be magical­
     ly summoned into your nation via the "Summon" spell, or they  can
     wander  into your national service through the use of the Monster
     Powers of Orc, Ogre and Dragon.  Once a monster has  joined  your
     nation, that monster will be much like normal army troops, except
     that the monster requires jewels as supplies.

     In terms of summoning requirements, each monster  has  a  certain
     cost  in spell points associated with it, along with a jewel cost
     per turn.  The types of monsters which are summonable  is  deter­
     mined  by  the  various  magical powers which a nation possesses.
     Also, if you wish to Send a monster against another  nation,  the
     spell point cost is double that of the summoning cost.
