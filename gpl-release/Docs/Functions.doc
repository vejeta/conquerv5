
The Functionality of Conquer

     Almost  all  of the commands within Conquer have been given func­
     tion names.  These names may be used to reassign keybindings, ad­
     justing  the feel of Conquer to fit other preferences.  In gener­
     al, Conquer bindings are based on emacs and/or vi keys,  so  most
     users  will be able to adjust quickly to the default keybindings.

     Conquer consists of a number of different keybinding maps, for  a
     total  of seven different modes.  The "global" commands cover all
     of the top level Conquer functions available while looking at the
     main  map  window.  The "move" keymap handles all of the bindings
     during unit or civilian relocation.  The  "magic"  commands  deal
     with  those  functions  used while perusing or purchasing magical
     powers.  The "xfer" keymap is for the screen where goods,  units,
     and  people  are  transfered  between two storage locations.  The
     "reader" keymap is for use in the mail reader.  The "mail" keymap
     is  for  when  a new mail message is being written.  Finally, the
     "info" keymap is used for keybindings in the  nation  information
     screen.

     Again,  if  any  of the default key bindings are unsuitable, they
     may be adjusted using the customization system  built  into  Con­
     quer.  [For more information, see Customize]

     At  any  time,  help may be obtained using `?' (`ESC-?' if in the
     "mail" editor).  This help listing will provide access to a list­
     ing of all of the commands and keybindings in the current keymap.

The Global Function Keys

     The "global" keymap provides the overall control for Conquer, al­
     lowing  players to access all of the other keymaps and functions.
     The other purpose of the "global" keymap is  to  select  military
     units  within  the current sector, or to move between the various
     sectors.

     The movement commands  are  available  with  both  the  top-level
     keymap  and the "move" keymap.  But, within the "move" keymap the
     scrolling commands are not available.

     Selection of units is very important, since a unit will  need  to
     be selected before orders may be given to it.  There are a number
     of commands which handle this task.

     Finally, with the display and digestion of information being very
     important in game play, there are numerous functions available to
     select what sort of information is displayed on the screen.  Most
     of  this information is directly available at the "global" level,
     with precise  details  being  available  in  some  of  the  other
     keymaps.

The Movement Commands

     Of all of the commands available to the players of Conquer, those
     which control the selection of the current sector  will  get  the
     most use, and as such, should be memorized first.

     By  default,  the VI keys (hjklyubn) are set to all of the motion
     commands.  The upper case  equivalents  provide  functions  which
     scroll the screen in the given direction.  Also, the numeric key­
     pad is available for those that wish  to  use  that  alternative.
     For the numeric keypad, you may use a period followed by the num­
     ber to scroll in the appropriate direction.

     The directions provided by the standard VI keys and numeric  key­
     pad is shown using the following diagrams:

               `y' `k' `u'                     `7' `8' `9'
                 \  |  /                         \  |  /
                  \ | /                           \ | /
              `h'--` '--`l'                   `4'--` '--`6'
                  / | \                           / | \
                 /  |  \                         /  |  \
               `b' `j' `n'                     `1' `2' `3'

          Upper Case to Scroll             Use ".#" to Scroll

     The  full names of the movement functions are of the form "go-di­
     rection", such  as  "go-north",  "go-southwest".   The  scrolling
     functions are likewise, "scroll-direction".

     Note  that with a hexagonal map, the directions west and east are
     not available during the movement mode, since there are only  six
     compass directions.

Display Commands

     During  the  normal  interface  mode  of  Conquer, the map of the
     world, or a portion of that map, is displayed to the player.  For
     each sector, there is a good deal of information which may be ob­
     tained.  In order to quickly digest  the  large  amount  of  data
     within  the  world,  the global view of the map can be changed to
     show different information to the user.  The  "display"  commands
     provide  the  method for making such changes.  The commands, with
     their default bindings within parenthesis, are as follows:

     adjust-display (`d') -- Select which display method  is  used  to
          show the information on the screen.

     customize-display (`D') -- Create new display modes or modify the
          existing display modes to your taste.

     adjust-view (`^D') -- Change the character  set  for  either  the
          vegetation,  the  major  designations, or the contour of the
          land.  This command is useful to allow a clearer distinction
          between  different vegetations, designations, or elevations.

     shift-focus (`)',`+') -- Rotate the focus position clockwise.

     shift-focus-back (`(') --  Rotate  the  focus  position  counter-
          clockwise.

     highlight-all (`=') -- Change all of the highlighting characters.

     highlight-current (`,') -- Change  the  highlight  at  the  focus
          character.

     highlight-horizontal  (`-')  -- Change the highlight of the focus
          and neighboring character.

     highlight-upleft-lowright (`\') -- Change the  highlight  of  the
          upper left and lower right characters.

     highlight-upright-lowleft  (`/')  --  Change the highlight of the
          upper right and lower left characters.

     highlight-vertical (`|') -- Change the highlight of  the  current
          character and the character above or below.

     troop-listing  (TAB)  --  Display  a list of all troops under the
          control of other nations which are visible  in  the  current
          sector.

     toggle-infomode  (`@') -- Toggle between the standard Conquer map
          display and a mode which provides more information about the
          current sector.

     zoom-in  (`>')  --  If possible, give a more detailed look at the
          sectors on the map.

     zoom-out (`<') -- Enlarge the scale of the map, if possible,  and
          display more sectors than are currently shown.

     It  should be noted that the `^D' construct indicates a Control-D
     character, which is obtained by holding down  the  "Control"  key
     and then pressing the `D' key.

     Details concerning the display commands can be found elsewhere in
     the documentation.  [For more information, see Display]

Selection Commands

     Selecting a specific military unit or sector is necessary  before
     that  unit or sector may receive commands.  The current sector is
     indicated on the map portion of the screen by  the  placement  of
     the cursor, and information about the sector will be displayed in
     the non-map portions of the screen.  If any units are in the cur­
     rent  sector they will be listed on the right side of the screen.
     The unit which is highlighted and has a character other than  the
     normal "greater than" sign next to it is considered the "current"
     unit.  [The character used will be either a plus sign or  an  as­
     terisk.]

     The commands available for changing selections are:

     army-choose  (`^A',`^G')  --  Set  the current unit to be a given
          army unit.  This will adjust the current sector to the loca­
          tion  of  the  army, if it is not already within the current
          sector.

     army-next (`A',`G') -- Set the current unit to be the  next  army
          unit  (in  numerical  order).  If needed, the current sector
          will also be adjusted.

     caravan-choose (`^V') -- Set the current unit to be a given cara­
          van.   Again, the sector of focus is adjusted if the unit is
          not within the current sector.

     caravan-next (`V') -- Set the current unit to be the  numerically
          next  caravan  unit.  The current sector will be adjusted if
          the unit is not already within the current sector.

     city-choose (`^E') -- Relocate the current sector to the city  of
          choice within the nation.

     jump-to-capital  (`X') -- Set the current sector to be capital of
          the nation.

     jump-to-mark (`^X') -- Adjust the current sector to a  previously
          stored  location  (see  the "mark-sector" command) or to the
          national capital if one has not been stored.

     jump-to-pick (`x') -- Set the current sector to a specified  sec­
          tor, which is entered by coordinates.

     mark-sector (NULL-key) -- This command will mark the current sec­
          tor so that it may later be returned to using the  "jump-to-
          mark" command.

     navy-choose  (`^F')  --  Set the current unit to be a given naval
          fleet.  Again, the sector of focus is adjusted if  the  unit
          is not within the current sector.

     navy-next  (`F')  --  Set the current unit to be the next, in as­
          cending numerical order, naval fleet.   The  current  sector
          will be adjusted if need be.

     pick-next (`p') -- Select the next unit by displayed order within
          the current sector, regardless of unit type.   This  command
          will never change the current sector.

     pick-previous  (`o') -- Select the preceding unit within the cur­
          rent sector, as indicated by the display.  This command will
          also never cause the current sector to be changed.

     Note  that  the  NULL-key  is  usually defined to be `^@' or `^ '
     (Control-Space).

Unit Manipulation Commands

     Within Conquer, there are three types of  military  units:  army,
     navy,  and  caravan  units.   Since  the  actions of a nation are
     greatly dependent on the power, location,  and  grouping  of  its
     military,  there  are a number of commands available to allow the
     manipulation of such units:

     army-report (`a') -- Display a listing of all of the armies with­
          in  the  nation,  and  allow  the manipulation of army units
          while examining the summary.

     auto-army-numbering (`#') -- The choice of  how  to  number  army
          units  can  make  selection and identification of army units
          easier.

     caravan-report (`v') -- Summarize the data concerning all of  the
          caravans within the nation, and allow the adjustment of car­
          avans while examining such data.

     command-unit (ESC-key) -- Perform a  quick  manipulation  of  the
          currently  selected  unit (army, navy, or caravan).  Some of
          the options include:  adjusting the speed,  renumbering  the
          unit,  changing  the  unit status, setting the supply level,
          etc.

     enlist (`E') -- Create a new army, navy or caravan from the  peo­
          ple  and  resources  within  the sector.  The current sector
          must be a stockade, town, city or capital for it  to  enlist
          troops.  Drafted troops are taken from the population of the
          sector.  Upgrading of units is also possible using this com­
          mand.

     group-report  (`g')  --  This  command  provides a summary of the
          armies within the nation, just like the  "army-report"  com­
          mand, but it limits the data to only those armies within the
          current sector.

     move-unit (`m') -- The is one of the most useful commands  within
          the program, as it allows the player to relocate a unit from
          one sector to another.  The cost and method of unit movement
          will  vary  with the type of unit, terrain and nation abili­
          ties.  [For more information, see Movement]

     navy-report (`f') -- This command will provide a summary  of  all
          of the naval fleets within the nation, and allow the manipu­
          lation of the units while looking at the data.

     transfer (`t') -- Move items between a caravan or navy and a city
          or  another  caravan  or  navy.  The currently selected unit
          will be used as the target of the transfer.  Goods may  also
          be transfered directly between cities using the "region-com­
          mand".  [For more information, see Economics]

     Normally the ESC-key is a single button,  or  `^['  (Control-Left
     Bracket).

Informational Commands

     In addition to having a need to manipulate the different military
     units of your nation, players must be provided with an  organized
     method for retrieving all of the information concerning their na­
     tion and the world around them.  The army, navy, and caravan  re­
     ports are examples of just such commands.  Some more commands for
     obtaining information are:

     campaign-info (`I') -- This command will provide a summary of the
          settings  for  this  particular  campaign.  Most importantly
          this screen will indicate many of the  settings  which  were
          used  when  the world was created, giving the player an idea
          of the difficulty of the environment around the nation.

     conquer-options (`0') -- Through the conquer-options command, the
          player is able to adjust keybindings, and choose a new rela­
          tive center for the nation.  [For more information, see Cus­
          tomize]

     diplomacy-report (`S') -- This command is used to review what na­
          tions you have met and what your diplomatic  status  is  to­
          wards  these nations.  Here is where you may adjust the sta­
          tus of your nation towards other nations, declaring  war  or
          offering a treaty.  [For more information, see Nations]

     economy-report  (`e') -- Careful monitoring of the economic pros­
          perity of your nation is necessary for  your  survival,  and
          this  command  is  the quickest means for obtaining a report
          concerning your nation on a global or regional basis.   [For
          more information, see Economics]

     help  (`?')  -- List all of the functions and associated keybind­
          ings.

     magic-info (`W') -- Display the list of your national powers,  as
          well as provide a method for gaining more.  [For more infor­
          mation, see Powers]

     nation-info (`i') -- There are a number  of  national  parameters
          which can give a good indication as to the strength and well
          being of your nation.  This command provides access  to  all
          such parameters governing your nation, and allows you to ad­
          just those which within your immediate control.   [For  more
          information, see Nations]

     toggle-infomode  (`@')  --  Mentioned under the display commands,
          this information providing  function  was  worth  mentioning
          again.  [For more information, see Display]

     troop-listing (TAB) -- Also mentioned under the display commands,
          this command really isn't worth mentioning  a  second  time,
          but I thought I would anyway.

     world-scores  (`s') -- It is always a good idea to keep an eye on
          what other people are up to.  This  command  gives  a  short
          summary of all of the nations in the world and, if your cam­
          paign allows it, a description of their strengths.

Communication Commands

     Conquer has been designed as a multi-player fantasy wargame, with
     much of the emphasis being on the multi-player portion.  As such,
     communication with other nations is very important, and there are
     a few commands available to facilitate that:

     mail-nation (`M') -- Send mail to another nation.

     read-mail  (`R') -- Read, reply to, and forward mail send to your
          nation.

     read-paper (`P') -- Check what is happening in the  world  around
          you.

     A  more  detailed  description  of the mail facility can be found
     elsewhere  in  the  documenation.   [For  more  information,  see
     Xchanges]

Nation Control Commands

     Being  able  to  manipulate  the world around you can give such a
     nice feeling.  So, in order to allow the player to get that feel­
     ing  of power that we all need in our lives, there are a few com­
     mands available to the ruler of a nation which allow the  manipu­
     lation of the population and the land:

     change-designation  (`c')  -- Adjust the designation for the cur­
          rent sector.  [For more information, see Sectors]

     construct (`C') -- Add to the  value  of  a  sector  by  building
          things  such  as fortifications, churches, granaries, or any
          other minor designations.  [For more information,  see  Sec­
          tors]

     move-people  (`Z')  --  Relocate civilians at a cost of 50 talons
          per person to within a two sector radius.  [For more  infor­
          mation, see Movement]

     region-command (`r') -- Rename a supply center, change weighting,
          distribute supplies, or transfer raw materials.   [For  more
          information, see Economics]

Miscellaneous Commands

     Some functions just can't be put into any category:

     ignore-key  (`  ')  -- Well, this command does just what it says:
          the key will be ignored if it is hit.   This  is  useful  to
          avoid  having  a bell ring everytime you hit a key which you
          already know is useless.

     recenter-screen (`^R') -- This command  will  cause  the  current
          sector  to be centered within the map portion of the Conquer
          display.

     redraw-screen (`^L') -- This command will cause the screen to  be
          redrawn.

     Both  the  "ignore-key"  and  "redraw-screen" functions should be
     available through all of the Conquer key-maps.

Is this the end?

     Well, there is still the big question: How do I get out  of  Con­
     quer?  For some people, once you are hooked, forget it.  But, for
     those few who can actually stop playing, there are the  following
     commands:

     login-nation  (`z') -- Switch control to another nation, continu­
          ing the addiction.

     quit (`q') -- Okay, so you do want out.  This is the  command  to
          do it.

     quit-and-save  (`Q')  --  This command not only lets you out, but
          informs Conquer that you are ready for the game to be updat­
          ed.   When  all  players  have indicated such, early updates
          might be able to take place.  [For  now  this  does  nothing
          more than the "quit" function]
