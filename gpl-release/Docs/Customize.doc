
Tailoring Conquer

     During  the writing of Conquer, there were many times when people
     have said that they wanted things done differently from the way I
     envisioned  it.   While  I could very easily have told them where
     they can take their "valuable  suggestions"  :-),  I  found  that
     there  were  one  or two of them that were bigger than me.  So, I
     decided that I would listen politely to the suggestions and then,
     if  possible, make it an option.  Of course, I still decided what
     options were the "default" ones, so I ended up with the last  say
     anyway.

     There  are now many things within Conquer which allow the user to
     specify how the user interface is to behave for them.   The  dis­
     play  modes  can be created or adjusted at will, the key bindings
     can be manipulated in almost any manner, and there are  a  number
     of flags which can be set based on the tastes of the user.

     Except  for  the display modifications, which are under the "cus­
     tom-display" function [For more information, see Display]  ,  all
     of  the  configuration  commands  are kept under the "conquer-op­
     tions" command.  This command provides a list of options by which
     the user may set a number of different preferences, including the
     rebinding of the entire key map of Conquer.

     It should be noted that in all of the portions  of  Conquer  con­
     taining key maps, the key bindings may be adjusted by calling the
     "conquer-options" command while within that mode.

The conquer-options Command

     Conquer currently supports twenty-one different options under the
     "conquer-options"  function.   After  executing  the "conquer-op­
     tions" function, type in the name of the desired option  to  make
     use of it.  The complete list of options, and their meanings, is:

     all-blanks -- On detailed zoom, leave any unused  bottom  charac­
          ters of the sector blank, as opposed to the normal method of
          using underlines.

     bind-key -- Interactively assign a set of keystrokes  to  call  a
          function.

     bottom-lines  -- For detailed zooms, set the bottom of characters
          of water sectors to be underlines, unless either "water-bot­
          toms" or "all-blanks" is enabled.

     check-keys  --  Verify  that all key bindings in the current mode
          are properly set.  Any conflicts or missing  functions  will
          be reported as they are encountered.  This is done each time
          Conquer is started.

     expert -- This toggles the setting of the  "expert"  option.   If
          Conquer  considers  you  an expert, it will no longer verify
          most commands, and will assume you know what you are  doing.
          Any complaints resulting from the use of this option will be
          given due consideration.

     gaudy -- When enabled, any time the nation's name is  encountered
          within the news, it will be highlighted so as to improve its
          readability.

     header-mode -- If on, the header summary will be shown  upon  en­
          tering  the mail editor, otherwise the next unread mail mes­
          sage will immediately be displayed.

     info-mode -- It is possible to toggle whether or not more  infor­
          mation  about  the current sector will be visible during the
          Conquer map display.  The command "toggle-infomode" is  also
          provided, since this is an option which should be enabled or
          disabled with ease.

     mail-check -- If on, and your system supports  it,  Conquer  will
          check the mail spool to determine if any real electronic has
          been sent.  Turning this option off will  prevent  "hanging"
          if an NFS mounted mail spool directory becomes inaccessible.

     pager-offset -- Specify how many lines down the screen  the  Con­
          quer pager focus line is.

     pager-scroll  --  Specify  how  many lines the Conquer pager will
          scroll when paged.

     pager-tab -- The number of spaces used to represent a tab charac­
          ter  are  controlled  by this option.  A value of zero indi­
          cates that the tab should remain unconverted.

     read-opts -- Read in a file that is in the ".conqrc" format.

     rebind-key -- Assign a currently  used  key  binding  to  another
          function.

     recenter-map -- Assign the current sector location to be the rel­
          ative center of the national coordinate map.  This  provides
          a method of aligning coordinate systems between nations.

     reset-keys -- Restore the key bindings to their default settings,
          making it possible to at least recover from  any  keybinding
          problems.

     store-opts  -- Store all of the current Conquer configuration op­
          tions into an automatically  generated  customization  file.
          A  query  is  made  to determine the exact file location for
          such an operation.  Note that "nation"  and  "campaign"  are
          not stored to avoid the possibility of overwriting prior de­
          faults.

     supply-level -- When a military unit is created, it will automat­
          ically  be built with food and payment for a given number of
          turns.  This option controls how many such supplies are pro­
          vided.

     terminal-bell  -- If on, Conquer will beep, if possible, whenever
          an error occurs.

     unbind-key -- Remove a given key binding  from  the  current  key
          map.

     water-bottoms  -- If on, the bottom portion of water sectors will
          always be shown with water, and not underlines, in  the  de­
          tailed zoom.

Building a Customization File

     Conquer  provides support for customization files, which take the
     form of  plain  text  files  containing  configuration  commands.
     These files can be created manually, or can be automatically gen­
     erated using the "store-opts" option from  the  "cnoquer-options"
     function.

     The  configuration  file  consists  of a list of single line com­
     mands, along with comments, which are indicated by a number  sign
     (#) as the first non-space character.  The list of supported cus­
     tomization commands, and their meanings, is:

     include: path-to-file
          Through the use of the "include" customization command,  the
          user is able to specify additional customization files to be
          read in by Conquer.  This is very useful for breaking  apart
          the  customization  environment into separate parts for ease
          of control.  [In the future, I plan  to  enable  conditional
          include options to allow customization based on the terminal
          type or other information]

     nation: nationname
     name: nationname
          Both of the above commands are used to specify a default na­
          tion  to  be  used by the player.  These are useful to avoid
          having to always specify the  nation  name  on  the  command
          line.   This may be overridden by either the command line or
          the environment variable.

     campaign: campaignname
     data: campaignname
     directory: campaignname
          These customization commands provide the user with a  method
          of  specifying  a default campaign to be accessed.  They may
          be overridden by either the command line or the  environment
          variable.

     all-blanks
     bottom-lines
     expert
     gaudy
     header-mode
     info-mode
     mail-check
     terminal-bell
     water-bottoms
          All  of  the  above commands turn the appropriate option on.
          If it is proceeded by a `!' character, that option is turned
          off.

     supply-level: #
          Set number of supply units each unit should receive when en­
          listed.

     pager-tab: #
     pager-scroll: #
     pager-offset: #
          The above options, followed by a numeric indicate  that  the
          appropriate variables should be given the indicated value.

     zoom-level: detail
          The  zoom  level  setting  indicates what the beginning zoom
          setting will be.  The zoom level  may  be  either  "detail",
          "medium", or "full".

     contour Type=C
     vegetation Type=C
     designation Type=C
          Specify  what characters are to be used to display the indi­
          cated contour, vegetation or designation types.

     unbind-key map "keystr"
     bind-key map "keystr" function-name
     rebind-key map "keystr" function-name
          The above commands allow for  the  specification  of  a  key
          binding  for  an  indicated  Conquer key map.  The currently
          available maps are global, mail, magic,  move,  and  reader.
          The  key  string  is  a set of characters enclosed by either
          single or double quotes.  The key string should be  composed
          entirely of displayable characters, with a `^' character be­
          ing interpreted as an indicator for control characters,  and
          the '\' character being used to give "C" style character se­
          quences or just to quote a given character.

     display-mode "Name" highlight style
     display-mode "Name" focus hexloc
     display-mode "Name" hexloc style
          Create or modify display modes and  its  display,  focus  or
          highlighting  settings.   A  hexloc  indicates  the position
          which can be either low-left,  low-right,  up-left  or  low-
          right.   The  styles  are  the display or highlight settings
          which are available to the user.  The focus command is  used
          to indicate which of the four hexloc positions is to be con­
          sidered the most important.

     default-display highlight style
     default-display focus hexloc
     default-display hexloc style
          Set the default display mode settings in much the same  man­
          ner as the named display modes.  This default display method
          is used Conquer is first entered.

The Environment Variable

     In addition to the the customization file, Conquer provides  sup­
     port  for  an  the "CONQ_OPTS" environment variable.  I won't get
     into a discussion on how to set the  environment  variable  here,
     since that varies with each user's shell or operating system, and
     is usually easy to do.  But, I will describe just what things can
     be set using the environment variable.

     The environment variable is not quite as robust as the customiza­
     tion file, but it does provide a quick way of overriding many op­
     tions which were set in such a file, without having to permanent­
     ly change that file.  Anyway, the environment variable supports a
     list  of mostly one character items which correspond with Conquer
     options:

     B
          A `B' character indicates to enable the "all-blanks" option.
          It may be disabled by preceding it with a `!' character.

     b
          A  `b'  character indicates to enable the "bottom-lines" op­
          tion.  It too may be disabled with a preceding  `!'  charac­
          ter.

     e
          An  `e'  represents the "mail-check" option.  It may be dis­
          abled by preceding it with a `!'.  A

     G
          The "gaudy" highlighting option is enabled with a single `G'
          option, and may be disabled by preceding it with a `!' char­
          acter.

     H
          The "header-mode" is controlled with a  `H'  character.   If
          preceded by a `!' character, it may be disabled.

     i
          Choosing  to  start with info-mode enabled is done using the
          `i' character within the environment variable.  The `!' will
          disable it.

     t
          Enabling  the  "terminal-bell" option is done with a `t'.  A
          preceding exclamation point will disable it.

     w
          The "water-bottoms" option is set using  the  `w'  flag,  or
          disabled with a '!w' sequence.

     x
          Becoming an "expert" is no problem, just use the `x' charac­
          ter within the environment variable.  Disable with an excla­
          mation point.

     name=nationname
          The  name  of  the  nation to be used may be specified using
          this option.  Be sure to use a comma to end it, if there are
          any additional options after it.

     data=campaign
          Finally,  the  campaign  may be specified through the use of
          this option.  It should also be distinguished from following
          option through the use of a comma.

     As an example, if a player using csh wished to enable "gaudy" and
     "water-bottoms", along with disabling  "all-blanks",  they  could
     use the following, which would also set their name and campaign:

        setenv CONQ_OPTS 'Gw!b,name=Mordor,data=MiddleEarth'

     While  the environment variable cannot be used to specify display
     modes, screen characters, or pager variables, it does have a num­
     ber  of  useful  features which can make it easy to override cus­
     tomization file settings.

The Command Line

     There are two main programs which  compose  the  Conquer  system:
     conquer,  the user interface, and conqrun, the administrative in­
     terface.  If you wish to get an exact list of the options  avail­
     able  when  running each program, you may use "conquer -" or "conqrun -" respec­
     tively.

     To the sake of completeness, I will list all of the command  line
     options  for both here as well.  For the conquer command, the op­
     tions are:

  Command line format: conquer [-nc] [-BbeGHhilMpsw -d DIR -nNAT]
        -nc      do not read in .conqrc file [first option only]
        -n NAT   play as nation NAT
        -d DIR   use to access different campaign
        -B       use blanks, not underlines [toggle]
        -b       always underline water [toggle]
        -e       don't check for system email [toggle]
        -G       highlight name in news [toggle]
        -H       use header-mode option [toggle]
        -i       don't set info-mode option [toggle]
        -t       don't enable warning bells [toggle]
        -w       draw water with no underlines [toggle]
        -X       enable expert status [toggle]
        -l       dislay list of user logged in
        -h       print help text
        -P       print a map with highlighting
        -p       print a map
        -s       print scores
        -M       edit the MOTD, if allowed
        -D       dump nation information

     Those selections with the [toggle] at the  end  are  the  Conquer
     configuration options, which indicate, by the presence or absence
     of the string "don't ", what will be done if they are enabled  on
     the  command line.  The conqrun command also have a number of se­
     lections:

  Command line format: conqrun [-nc] [-ACEQITZamx -dDIR]
        -nc      do not read in .conqrc file [first option only]
        -E       edit the world campaign settings
        -I       display some statistics
        -A       add some npc nations to the nations file
        -Q       examine the combat dice probabilities
        -T       (dis/en)able logins; 120 sec time to finish for those in
        -Z       delete all npc nation specifications
        -a       add new player
        -d DIR   to specify a different game directory
        -o ofile send update output to the given file
        -m       make a world
        -x       execute program

     As you can tell from the above lists, you may  avoid  reading  in
     the  Most of the Conquer settings are just parallels of the envi­
     ronment variable options, except that they act  as  toggles.   To
     find out exactly what each option does, you can probably just try
     it out and see what happens.
