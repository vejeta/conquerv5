Economic conditions play a crucial role in the development and growth
of a nation within Conquer.  Each nation must properly manage the
resources available, and distribute them where they are needed.
Troops will need supplies in order to survive, and ships and caravans
will need materials for contruction and repairs.  Civilians will need
food during every turn, and the sectors will need materials just to
keep current designations in place, if not to build new ones.
.PP
All of the economics issues revolve around the ability of the nation
to acquire and distribute the materials available to it.  And there are
many methods available for both the acquisition and the distribution,
it is up to the player controlling the nation to decide what is best
and when.
.CE
.CS "Economics 101: Resources"
.PP
There are five types of raw materials within Conquer:  talons, metals,
jewels, wood and food.  Each is required for different uses, and each
must be produced in different ways:
.PP
Talons -- The basic monetary unit of conquer, gold talons are
generated from the taxation of the population.  The taxation level is
totally controllable by the player, so if more talons are needed, more
taxes can be gathered.  Of course, with higher taxes, there is much
higher discontent, and a greater risk of rebellion against your rule.
The amount of talons generated varies with the type of the sector and
the sector population; lumberyards, iron mines, jewel mines, and the
farm sectors all generate talons based on the production of the
sector.  The remaining sectors have a fixed income for each person in
the sector, which is greater if the sector is of more importance.
.PP
Metals -- Metals are used in the construction of buildings and
fortifications, as well as the supplying of many troops.  Metals are
generated by mining them from the earth.  Various sectors contain
metal deposits, such as iron, copper, adamantine and mithril.  These
sectors have available to them a certain amount of metal, which is
related to the quality of the type of metal within the sector; for
each unit of metal value for a sector, each miner within the sector
will produce 1 unit of metal per turn.  But, finding the metals is not
as simple as it might be.  Each nation has given "mining ability" and
"metalworking ability", the average of which is used to compute the
likelihood of being able to recognize the metallic tradegoods.  In
order to find the better metal types, the nation must possess a better
mining and metalworking ability.
.PP
Jewels -- Jewels are used to gain the services of various monsters,
and to increase the magic powers and energy of a nation.  Jewels,
really gems and precious metals, are produced very much like metals.
There are various forms of jewel types, such as rubies, gold, silver
and platinum.  And each nation possesses a certain level of ability
for finding and mining such jewels.  Much like with Metals, nations
have a "jewelworking" ability which, when averaged with the mining
ability determines what types of jewels are able to be mined by the
nation.
.PP
Wood -- Wood is used in the construction of naval vessels and for
defensive fortifications.  As such, wood is a military necessity.
Wood is gained through the use of lumberyards.  Each vegetation type
has a certain wood yield which it may give, where woods and forests
have the highest production potential.  Special types of trees, such
as pine and oak, may also enhance the yield for a sector.  For each
wood value a sector possesses, it will produce ten units of wood per
person.
.PP
Food -- Food is a necessity of life, for both soldiers and civilians.
If soldiers or civilians run out of food supplies they are likely to
die of starvation.  Farms are used to grow food, but the farms must be
properly cultivated over a number of seasons or only a partial crop
will result.  A normal yield is 1 unit of food per person, per food
value of the sector, each turn.  During the spring, a sector must be
designated as a "Farm" sector.  This sector will produce a half yield.
As the seasons progress the farm will mature and become "Fertile"
during the summer, and "Fruitful" during the fall.  The fertile
sectors will produce a full yield, while the fruitful sectors will
produce a double yield.  During winter, the sector will revert back to
a "Farm" sector, and will not produce food again until the spring.
.CE
.CS "Economics 201: Supply and Demand"
.PP
Raw materials are stored within the special storage designations,
called "supply centers".  There are five supply center types: Cache,
Stockade, Town, City, and Capital.  Materials stored within any of
these designations will be made access to neighboring sectors,
military units and civilians.  If a unit, sector, or civilian does not
receive the resources needed for its survival, it will either die or
decay.  So, it is very important to maintain constant supply lines for
sectors and units.  Naval units and caravans can be used for mobile
short range supply sources, but with small storage capacities, they
can not be depended on as long term supply sites.
.PP
Each of the supply centers will gather raw materials from neighboring
sectors during the update, and then redistribute them, as needed, to
those same sectors.  The range of influence of a supply center varies
with the type of supply center, but is also a function of the national
communication range.  Each supply center also has a weighting assigned
to it, to determine what percentage of each sector's production it
should receive.  Weights may be adjusted by the player, but must not
be less than the default value for that supply center.  The default
range and weighting of a supply center is given by the table below:
.TB
   Supply Center Type     Influence Range (min)    Default Weight
   ====================   ======================   ========================
   National Capital       NTN_COMM + 1.0  (3.0)    128
   City Sector            NTN_COMM        (3.0)    64 + 1 per 1,000 people
   Town Sector            NTN_COMM / 2.0  (2.0)    32 + 1 per 500 people
   Stockade               NTN_COMM / 4.0  (1.0)    10
   Cache                  0               (0.0)    0
.TE
.PP
To give an example of the weighting system: A farm sector produces
10,000 units of food and is within the influence of the Capital, 1
City of 8,000 people and a town of 750 people.  The weight of each,
respectively, is 128, 72 [64 + 8], and 33 [32 + 1].  The total weight
is 233, and the food received by each should be:
.SB
       Sector           Weight         Food Received
       ============     ==========     ==========================
       Capital          128            10,000 x 128 / 233 = 5493
       City             72             10,000 x 72 / 233 = 3090
       Town             33             10,000 x 33 / 233 = 1416
.SE
.PP
The 1 food unit lost because of integer division can be thought of as
slipping through the cracks of bureaucracy.
.PP
Now, when a sector consumes items, the distribution of materials to
that sector is handled by taking into account how much of the required
item nearby supply centers possess.  So, if a farm needs 500 units of
wood and there is one neighboring city with 1,000 wood and another
with 4,000 units of wood, 100 would be taken from the first city and
400 from the second.  As you can tell, this is totally independent of
the weighting scheme used to distribute raw materials after
production.
.CE
.CS "Economics 301: Supplying the Military"
.PP
One of the more advanced options of Conquer is that of requiring that
military units be supplying.  Since armies, navies, and caravans can
each roam well outside the national boundaries and supply center
ranges, they must each carry what they needed to survive.
.PP
The food and talons (and any other items needed for survival) are
lumped together in one packages called a "supply".  During every
update, each unit will consume 1 supply.  There is a limit to the
number of supplies a military unit may carry with them, so the units
will need to constantly be resupplied in order to continue their
activities.  This will be done automatically if they are within range
of a supply center during an update.  Otherwise, there are a number of
commands, including the "region-command" and "command-unit" commands,
which may be used to provide units with supplies.  But, when
resupplying a unit using a manual method, the unit must be in
territory controlled by their nation, or the supplies cannot be
transported to them.
.PP
The composition of military supplies varies.  For most army units, the
supplies are composed of the monthly pay and the food needed for
survival.  For monster units, the supplies are composed of the jewels
needed to bribe the creature(s).  Leaders and scouts, being single man
units, need not be supplied as they can live off the land.  Naval
units need talons for payment as well as food for their crew.  And
finally, caravans also need to be given payment as well as food for
their crew.
.PP
Distribution of supplies is automated over land based connections, so
if a unit is on land, they may receive materials from any storage
location which is on land and within range.  It should be noted that
the raw materials for the supplies may be taken from supply centers,
both the static cities, towns, etc. and the mobile caravans and
navies.  So, if you are planning on sending a troop of soldiers off
into the world on their own, be sure to send along a fully loaded
caravan or navy with them.

.CS "Displaying Economic Information"
.PP
Gathering information about economic conditions is an essential part
of economic management.  So, knowing how to properly use the Conquer
display routines is very important.
.PP
If your nation, or a portion of the nation, does not have enough of
any of the raw materials, it will be necessary to designate a sector
to produce more of whatever is needed.  In order to do this, you will
have to determine what sectors within range of the supply center(s) in
question contain the most potential for generating the needed
materials.  There are a few display modes built in to display wood,
food, jewel, and metal potential for sectors.  Also, you can turn on
highlighting to indicate the range of supply centers.
.RF "Display" "Conquer Data Display Routines"
If a sector is not already owned by your nation, it will be necessary
to capture it before you may make use of it.
.RF "Warfare" "Military Units and Combat"
.PP
Another key part of the display routines involves locating unsupported
sectors.  It is possible to highlight any sectors which are
unsupported by supply centers.  This means that the sector is not
within range of any supply centers, and thus will not receive supplies
to sustain civilians or constructions within the sector.  If you find
such sectors within your nation, it will be necessary to either
improve the communication range of the nation, or to build a new
supply center within range of the unsupported sector.
.CE
.CS "Paying for Sectors"
.PP
Each of the sectors which a nation owns requires certain materials to
maintain the sector and the things within the sector.  If the sector
possesses a designation or constructions, there are materials which
will be needed to upkeep the constructions and designation within the
sector.
.PP
The costs for the upkeep of a sector is computed by finding the base
cost for the sector designation, and adding on any additional costs
for constructions, modified by the designation multiplier.  So, using
the cost table in the Sector Information portion of the documentation,
a town sector with a blacksmith and a church would cost:
.TB
           Item                                Talons   Metals    Wood
    ======================================    ======== ======== ========
    Base Cost for a Town                         1000       20      200
    5x Cost for a Blacksmith                     2000        0       40
    5x Cost for a Church                         1500        0       50

    Total Costs for Sector                       4500       20      290
.TE
.PP
As the above calculations demonstrate, it is often the minor
designations that cost the most, since the basic functions of a town
are mostly self-sufficient.
.RF "Sector" "Sector Information"
.PP
In addition to the material expenses for a sector, the civilians
living within the sector will need to eat.  The food required is
simple to compute:  multiply the national "Eat Ratio" by the number of
civilians within the sector.
.PP
Costs may be reduced when magical civilian powers such as
"Accountant", "Metalcraft" and "Woodcraft" are obtained.

.CS "Economic Reports"

Since Conquer is a computer based game, it is capable of calculating
all of the consumption and production on either a regional or national
level.  Summaries about the costs for each supply center's realm of
influence (or region) are available through the "economy-report"
command.
.PP
This command brings up a full screen summary of the economic condition
within the nation.  There are three summary types:  the economic
report, the resource report, and the sector totals.  The economic
report summarizes talon consumption and intake, including an estimate
for the talon level for the next turn.  The resource report lists all
five resource (raw material) types with population, production, and
usage figures.  And the sector totals report list what type of
civilians live in which sector types within the scope of the summary.
All of these reports may be for a single supply center, or for the
entire nation.

This screen simply displays a summary of the sector population within

people in all four production types:  lumberyards, farm types

quite a network of cities within this nation.
.CE
.CS "Redistribution of Materials"
.PP
The best way to maintain economic stability within a nation is to make
sure that each supply center has some of each of the four production
type sectors within its range of influence.  There are times, however,
when this is not possible, such as when first establishing a new
supply center.  In such cases, it is often necessary to move materials
into the supply center from other supply centers in the area.
.PP
There are two ways to move materials into a supply center:  transfer
them directly from a nearby supply center or place them in a caravan
or navy and carry them there.
.PP
Transferring directly between supply centers is done using the
"region-command" function.  The maximum distance over which this is
possible is determined by the campaign administrator, but by default
is two sectors.  Placing a number of supply centers within range of
each other makes it possible to "string" supplies over long distances
from one supply center to another for free.  The problem with this
approach is that supplies may not be moved over more than one supply
center per month, so it might take a long time to get supplies to or
from cities farther out in the nation.
.PP
Transporting materials over land or water using caravans or navies
provides the quickest method of transfer, as long distances may
sometimes be covered over a single turn.  However, this method
requires materials to build the units, and civilians to crew the
transports.  Once a supply network of caravans and navies is in place,
though, the support costs are rather low and the speed of material
relocation is worth the added expenses.  Loading and unloading of
materials from caravans and navies is accomplished using the
"transfer" command or the (T)fer Cargo option of the "command-unit"
function.
.CE
.CS "The xfer screen"
.PP
The "xfer" screen used by both the "transfer" and "region-command"

the left and another on the right.  Using the "hjkl" keys items are
transferred between the two locations, and until the screen is quit,
items may be freely moved between the two sites.
.PP
Only those materials which may be transferred between the two storage
sites will be shown on the screen.  So army units will not be shown
unless the transfer is between a naval fleet with warships and a
sector with units or another warship fleet.  Also, once raw materials
are placed in a supply center, they are not able to be transferred
again until the next month.  This mechanism prevents "instant"
transfer of materials between supply centers from one end of a nation
to another.

The above screen shows an NPC Dwarven nation named Khazadum with a
ruler named Durin.  Whenever other nations encounter Khazadum, they
will see a 'k' on their maps, since that is its nation mark.  The
aggressiveness of the nation indicates that its troops will be mostly
defensive, and within their fortifications.  The tax rate is moderate,
with inflation and currency levels stable.
.PP
The eat rate is at a good low level, but the communication range is
a little low for a nation of this size.  The metal craft and mine
ability are very low and there is no magical power potential within
the nation.  Those are probably due to the nation not having either
shrines within magical sectors or metal mines.  Given the lack of wood
as well, it is possible that there are also no lumberyards within the
nation.  The last two items are potentially crippling.
.PP
On the whole, the nation seems to be in a bit of trouble, with most of
the attributes being very low to average, and the metal and wood
supplies having run out.  It will take a fair amount of work to get
this nation out of trouble, particularly in regard to the wood and
metal levels.
