
Cartography in Conquer

     With  Conquer version 5.0, hexagonal sectors and relative coordi­
     nate systems were introduced.  Combined,  these  changes  can  be
     more than a bit disorienting for players of the older versions of
     Conquer.  But, both of these changes greatly enhance game play by
     introducing more realism.

     The  shape  of the sectors may be selected during world creation,
     with the hexagonal map being the recommended choice.   With  this
     setup,  motion  in any of the six directions results in a reloca­
     tion of equal distance.  With rectangular sectors, distances  be­
     come  non-uniform,  as  can  be demonstrated by having motion one
     sector east followed by one sector north being equivalent to  mo­
     tion one sector to the north-east.

     The  numbering  of coordinates is along both the north-south axis
     and the east-west axis.  This can be somewhat confusing  for  the
     hexagonal  coordinate  system,  with there then being zig-zagging
     rows, but this provides a  one-to-one  relationship  between  the
     displayed  map  coordinates  and the internal data representation
     used.  Thus, some complex computations are avoided.

The Displaying of Data

     With information a key element to game play, being able to quick­
     ly  view  data  is  a must.  The display system in Conquer is de­
     signed to allow concise viewing of data through character  repre­
     sentations and display highlighting.

     There  are  three levels of detail available for the map display.
     The farthest out displays the most sectors, but  the  closest  in
     has a display of up to four characters for each sector.  This al­
     lows for a greater amount of data for each sector  to  be  shown.
     When  on the detailed zoom setting, one of the four characters is
     designated as the focus character and is indicated by  the  posi­
     tioning  of  the cursor within the sector.  There are a number of
     different types of data which may  be  shown  in  each  character
     slot,  and  there are also many methods of highlighting which may
     be employed upon each character slot.

     It is possible to build different combinations of character  dis­
     plays  and highlights to provide informative methods of gathering
     data.  The grouping of such display  and  highlight  settings  is
     called  a  "display mode".  There are a number of pre-built "dis­
     play modes", or others may be constructed using the display edit­
     ing commands.

Display Commands

     There are a number of commands available to allow for the adjust­
     ment of the display settings.  These commands range from  zooming
     controls  and information mode toggling to outright editing modes
     for display settings.

     The zooming commands are "zoom-in" and "zoom-out" which slide be­
     tween the various zooming levels.  To shift the focus between the
     four character slots, there are the "shift-focus" and  "shift-fo­
     cus-back"  commands which rotate the focus clockwise and counter-
     clockwise respectively.

     For those times when you want to get more information  about  the
     current sector (such as production, consumption, and minor desig­
     nations) there is the "info-mode".  When running under the  info-
     mode,  the  main  conquer display devotes a larger portion of the
     screen to show information concerning the  current  sector.   The
     right  side of the screen is totally devoted to listing the mili­
     tary units in the sector, and the map portion is relegated  to  a
     smaller  section  of the screen, in the upper left.  The "toggle-
     infomode" command is used to switch between  this  mode  and  the
     normal conquer map display.

     One  quick  command  which can sometimes come in handy is "troop-
     listing".  This command clears the entire  right  column  of  the
     screen  and  then uses this space to list all troops belonging to
     other nations within that space.  This is useful  whenever  there
     are  so many troops within the sector that they do not fit within
     what little space is leftover  after  the  listing  of  your  own
     troops.

     There  are  two commands which provide customizing of the display
     routines.  The simplest is the "adjust-view" command which allows
     the user to change the symbols used to represent the designation,
     vegetation or contour values.  Simply enter the selection  to  be
     changed  and  then give a printable character to use for the dis­
     play.  The much more complex command, "customize-display"  allows
     interactive  creation  or editing of new display modes.  Once the
     display mode has been created, it may be selected using the  "ad­
     just-display" command.

     Finally,  because  the  highlighting  of certain sectors can be a
     very quick method for interpreting data, there are  a  number  of
     commands that allow the quick adjustment of the highlighting pat­
     terns.  Those commands are: "highlight-all", "highlight-current",
     "highlight-horizontal",  "highlight-upleft-lowright", "highlight-
     upright-lowleft", and "highlight-vertical".

     The two pages which follow give the complete list of all  of  the
     display  and  highlighting  styles which conquer supports.  These
     lists are used as the basis for the display modes themselves.

List of Display Styles

     (c)ontour -- Show the elevation for all of  the  sectors  on
          the screen.

     (d)esignation -- Display the major designation value for any
          sectors whose designation is known.

     (f)ood -- Display the food production ability for all habit­
          able sectors.

     (j)ewel  -- Show the approximate jewel production ability of
          all habitable sectors.

          all owned sectors.

     (p)eople -- Display the  approximate  population  level  for
          owned sectors.  Arabic numerals (0 to 9), indicate hun­
          dreds of people, and Roman numerals (I, V, X, L)  indi­
          cate thousands of people.

     (r)ace  --  Show  the first letter of the race of the sector
          owner.  The races are: Human, Dwarf, Elf,  Orc,  Nomad,
          Pirate, Savage and Lizard.

     (v)egetation -- Show the type of vegetation contained within
          a sector.

     (w)ood -- Show the wood production ability for those sectors
          able to produce wood.

     (y)our  desg -- Display designation for sectors owned by the
          current nation, and the nation marks for others.

     (A)rmy mcost -- Display the relative cost for a  land  based
          unit to enter each sector.  This cost is used for cara­
          van units as well as army units.

     (D)efense -- Show defensive value for a sector based on  the
          vegetation and elevation of the sector.

     (F)light  mcost -- Display the cost, in movement points, for
          a flying unit to enter each sector.

     (M)agic value -- Display the magical potential of  the  sec­
          tors.

     (N)aval  mcost  --  Show the cost, in movement points, for a
          ship to enter a sector.  A `+' indicates that the  sec­
          tor may only be entered by landing the ship.

     (T)good  desgs -- Display designations necessary to take ad­
          vantage of the special items in sectors.

     (V)alues -- Show tradegood values  for  each  sector.   With
          jewel,  magical,  and  metal  tradegoods, the "mineral"
          value is shown, while other tradegood types  will  have
          the potency of the tradegood shown.

     (W)eights  --  Display  the relative weighting values of all
          supply centers within the nation.  This display is use­
          ful to get a feel for where materials will be dispersed
          after production.

     (b)lank -- No information is to be shown in this display po­
          sition.

     (K)eep  --  This  option  indicates that the current display
          style in this position should not be changed.  If  this
          is  encountered  in the actual display, it behaves like
          the blank display.

List of Highlight Styles

     (N)one -- Disable highlighting.

     (a)llies -- Highlight sectors owned by nations  friendly  to
          the current nation.

          supply center in the current sector.

     (s)couts  -- Highlight sectors which contain scouting units.

     (u)nits -- Highlight sectors containing armies,  navies,  or
          caravans.

     (y)our  units  -- Highlight those sectors containing armies,
          navies or caravans owned by the current nation.

     (M)ovable -- Highlight sectors  which  contain  units  which

          their supply centers.

     (K)eep  --  Do not change the highlighting when this display
          mode is selected.  If this style is encountered in  the
          actual  display, it behaves as if the "None" highlight­
          ing style is set.

The Normal Conquer Display Mode

     As you have probably noticed, the normal Conquer display shows  a
     map  of the world in most of the screen area.  This map will con­
     tain one or more character representations of the various sectors
     which are visible to your nation.  The position of the characters
     gives an indication of the relative location of  the  sectors  on
     the  map.   Sectors  towards  the top of the map are north of the
     sectors towards the bottom, and sectors to the left  of  the  map
     are west of the sectors on the right of the map.

     The  current  sector  is indicated by the position of the cursor.
     More information about the current sector, such as who  owns  it,
     what  the actual coordinates of the sector are, and what, if any,
     of your troops are within the sector, will  be  shown  along  the
     right-hand column of the display.  You can see an example of such
     a screen below:

                                                           *Wzrd 1 x=250 p=10
                                                             m:100 sp:= st:Dfd

     If you possess units within the current sector, information about
     each  of  the  individual troops will be shown, with two lines of
     information for each unit.  For armies, the information will con­
     tain the type of unit, the id number of the unit, the size of the
     unit, and the status and movement capabilities of the unit.   For
     navies,  the  id number of the fleet, the number of each class of
     ship within the fleet, and the status and  movement  capabilities
     of  the  unit will be shown.  And finally, the caravan units will
     have the size, id number, status and movement capabilities of the
     units  shown.  The currently selected unit within the sector will
     have a marker other than the `>' sign next to it.   Usually  this
     will  be  a  `*',  but  a `+' is used to indicate the leader of a
     group of army units or a ship or caravan which is carrying  items
     onboard.

     The above map shows all of the world which is visible to a nation
     "Aereol".  The currently selected sector is the  capital  located
     at  sector  [0,0] which is surrounded by a number of farming sec­
     tors.  There are a number of troops within the sector,  including
     the  nation  leaders  and Ruler, the "Wizard", which is currently
     selected.

Zoooooom...

     Conquer has support for both hexmap  and  rectangular  coordinate
     systems.   There  are  also  three levels of "zooming" available,
     where clarity of information will be traded off with  the  number
     of sectors visible as the scale increases.  Below are examples of
     each level of zooming, with the hexmap coordinate system  on  the
     left and the rectangular coordinate system on the right.

             ~ % % % ~ - F b ~ -              %-~~~~~~~--%%-j%,,
              % - - ~ ~ F F % -               ~~~~~~~~~%-FFF%jb,
             , , % % ~ ~ C b % %              ~~~~~~~~~-%~CFi%j-

             % , ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ - ~ ,              ~~~~~~~~~%-%-,^--j

     At the "full" zoom setting, only one display "slot" is available,
     but many sectors are visible at once. It should be noted, though,
     that  on  the hexmap, it is not possible to travel directly east-
     west, and that sectors are, however, connected with those direct­
     ly  to their north or south.  The rectangular system gains a much
     more compact display because of the  rectangular  orientation  of
     the screen.

         %   ~   -   F   b   ~   -          ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ - - % % - j
           ~   ~   F   F   %   -            ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ % - F F F %

         ~   ~   ~   ~   -   ~   ,          ~ ~ ~ ~ % - % - , ^ -

     At  the  "medium"  zoom  setting, less sectors are shown, but the
     sector positioning is more apparent for  the  hexmap.   For  your
     reference,  the  "designation"  display style is being used here,
     with the vegetation and elevations of  the  sectors  being  shown
     when there is no designation present.

       / %\__/~~\~~/ -\__/ %\__/ ^\       |~~|~~|~~| %| -| ^| ^| %| %|
       \__/~~\~~/~~\__/ %\F_/ %\__/       |~~|~~|~~|__|__|F_|F_|F_|__|
       / %\~~/~~\~~/~~\F_/ -\F_/ ^\       |~~|~~|~~| -| %|~~| %| ^| #|
       \__/~~\~~/~~\~~/~~\C_/ %\__/       |__|~~|__|__|__|__|C_|F_|__|

       \~~/~~\~~/~~\~~/~~\~~/ -\__/       |~~|~~|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|

     Finally, the "detail" zoom shows more information for each sector
     and demonstrates very clearly the  directional  relationship  be­
     tween  neighboring  sectors.  The important thing to note here is
     that there are now four characters of information for  each  sec­
     tor.

The Information Mode

     When it is desirable to obtain more information about the current
     sector than the standard conquer display provides,  the  informa­
     tion  mode is what you are looking for.  To enter the information
     mode, simply use  the  "toggle-infomode"  command,  and  it  will
     switch  between  the standard conquer display and the information
     mode.

     The information mode is very much like the standard conquer  dis­
     play, but the map takes up much less of the screen, and the extra
     space is filled by a section which will show as much  information
     about  the  sector  as  the  nation knows.  The right side of the
     screen is then totally devoted to the listing of the troops with­
     in the sector.

     An example of what might be shown in the information mode is:

       __/ %\__/ %\__         Capital of aereol [128]      *Wzrd 1 x=250 p=10

     The  display shown above concerns the Capital of the nation aere­
     ol.  The left portion of the screen is devoted to the map of sec­
     tors  around  the  capital, the right column to the troops within
     the capital area, and the middle of the screen shows a good  deal
     of information about the supply center itself.

     At  the  top of the information portion of the screen, the sector
     designation will be shown, with  the  value  of  the  designation
     shown  in  parenthesis.   For  supply  centers,  this will be the
     weight assigned to the sector; for farms, it  will  be  the  food
     value; for metal mines, the metal value; etc.

     Below  that will be listed all of the constructions, a.k.a. minor
     designations, as well as the attractiveness of the sector to  the
     civilians.   Immediately  below  the attractiveness is the sum of
     the weights of all supply centers within  support  range  of  the
     sector.   [In  the  above display, this shows that the capital is
     the only supply center within range]  Below that is the defensive
     value  of  fortifications within the sector.  At the very bottom,
     the production and consumption summary is given, so that you  can
     determine just where all of the national resources are going.

     If  the  sector  is  a  supply center, such as the capital above,
     there will be some added information, such as how many volunteers
     are  in the sector, what the influence range of the supply center
     is, and what materials are stored within the supply center.  Oth­
     erwise,  the number of civilians actually working within the sec­
     tor will be shown.  [For more information, see Sector]

The customize-display Command

     As stated earlier, a display mode consists of a specification for
     all  four character slots, highlight specifications, and a focus.
     There are, therefore, many possible combinations of display modes
     available.   The  command "customize-display" is used to create a
     specific combination, and perhaps give a name to it, so  that  it
     can be put to use at a later date.

     When  first executed, the list of currently defined display modes
     is listed.  Simply specify the name of the display mode you  wish
     to  edit,  and  press return.  If the display mode is not already
     defined, a new display mode will be created under that name.

     The bottom portion of the screen should look something like:

 Name: "Standard"      Display and Highlighting Selections               __
 Focus: low-left         blank / owned        | contour / owned         / -\
  '?' for commands       ---------------------+---------------------    \C_/
  'q' to exit            your desg / owned    | blank / owned

     The name of the mode being edited, the current focus position and
     the  two  brief  command  selections are listed on the left.  The
     settings for each position (or slot) are listed  in  the  middle.
     And  a  view  of  the current sector using the display mode under
     construction is on the right.

     So, you use the space to change the focus of  the  display  mode,
     then  use the `d' key to change the display style for a given po­
     sition.  You can also change the highlighting using the `h'  key,
     or  any  of the highlighting keys available in the normal conquer
     mode, and the name using the `n' key. If you wish to  return  the
     settings  to  the original values, the `r' key will perform a re­
     set.  All of these keybindings are mentioned when the `?' key  is
     pressed, if you should forget.

     Finally,  when  you  leave  the display customizer, using the `q'
     key, it will store your newly created display mode in the list of
     defined  display  modes.  It will then be accessible via the "ad­
     just-display" command.  If you specified to edit the current dis­
     play  mode,  conquer  will ask you if you wish to try to save the
     settings under some new name so that it will not be lost when you
     switch  to another display mode.  An important bit of information
     here:  the position of the focus when leaving the  customizer  is
     the value of the focus in the actual display mode.

     Be  aware,  though, that the customized display modes only remain
     in existence for the duration of  the  current  conquer  session.
     You  may have conquer store the settings, though, using the "con­
     quer-options" command and its "store-settings" subcommand.

Predefined Display Modes

     Conquer comes with a default list of display modes, so that play­
     ers  need  not design their own unless they wish to.  The list of
     predefined modes is:

       name      low-left  | low-right |  up-left   | up-right  |  focus
 =============  ===========|===========|============|===========|===========

 Blank             blank   |   blank   |   blank    |   blank   | low-left

     Note that all of the default display modes have a highlight style
     of  "Keep"  to  assure that they will not alter the current high­
     lighting method.
