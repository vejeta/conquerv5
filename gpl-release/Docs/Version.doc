
The History of Conquer

     Conquer  was originally developed by Edward Barlow under the name
     of "conquest".   It was then renamed to "Conquer" to avoid a con­
     flict with a program which already used that name.

     Conquer   has   been   posted   to   the   USENET   source  group
     "comp.sources.games" for a number of releases.  With version 3 of
     Conquer,  Adam  Bryant began pestering the author with bug fixes,
     enhancements and other annoying questions.  Ed felt it  necessary
     to  show  Adam  how annoying people who send "bug fixes, enhance­
     ments, and questions" can be by asking him to take over the  sup­
     port of Conquer with version 4.1.  Adam, naive as he was, accept­
     ed.

     After releasing ten patches (or eleven depending on how you count
     the  last  patch)  for version 4, it was realized that a complete
     rewrite would be needed to implement all  of  the  features  that
     would  be  needed.   So,  version 5.x represents a complete, from
     scratch, recoding of Conquer.  A list of most of the enhancements
     from  version  4 to version 5 is provided at the end of this sec­
     tion as a reference for those familiar with the earlier  version.

     The  original work was done on an AT+T machine with attempts made
     to keep it as portable as possible.  Later releases  and  patches
     were  done  on  a  BSD  Unix  Encore,  and Suns, with the current
     rewritten release being done almost entirely on Suns  of  various
     shapes  and  sizes.   Throughout  the rewrite, effort was made to
     conform to ANSI C standards while providing compatibility for  as
     many older compilers as possible.

Giving Thanks

     Throughout  the  life  of  Conquer, there has always been a great
     deal of help given by the members of the USENET community.  With­
     out  them,  Conquer would probably have died a lonely death years
     ago.  Some people helped just  by  making  marvelous  suggestions
     that  no  one  had  thought  of before, and others have helped by
     sending in patches and bug fixes based on their own hard work.

     While I would like to be able to thank every person who has  ever
     helped  with  Conquer,  there  are  just too many who have played
     parts to list them all.  If I  have  missed  someone  whose  work
     should have deserved mention, and I am sure there are many, it is
     only because of my poor memory and organizational skills.  I hope
     that  anyone who is left out, will be please forgive me, and send
     me a reminder to add them to the list.

     Just some of the people to whom Conquer is indebted:

     Jonathan Bayer    Brian Bresnahan   Dean Brooks       Richard Caley
     Andrew Collins    Ken Dalka         Paul Davison      Robert Deroy
     Bob Earl          Don Fast          Dave Flowers      Martin Forrsen
     Charles C. Fu     Derick Hirasawa   Richard Kennaway  Ernest Kim
     Tero Kivinen      Kenneth Moyle     Joe Nolet         Joe E. Powell
     Brian Rauchfuss   Eugene Wang

         The players at all of the Conquer sites around the world.

     with me if you think you should be added.

List of Version 5.x Changes

     There  are  many  adjustments which have been made to Conquer be­
     tween the release of Version 4.x and Version 5.x.  In a way, Con­
     quer  will  be more difficult for those players familiar with the
     earlier version, because they will expect to see the old  Conquer
     behavior.   So,  in order to allow people to become familiar with
     the new version as quickly as possible, I am providing this  sum­
     mary of changes and enhancements.

     ==  The world shape used by Conquer is no longer rectangular.  It
          is now that of a cylinder, where movement from left to right
          is wrapped, while that from top to bottom is not.

     == During world creation, a hexagonal or a rectangular coordinate
          system may be specified.

     == The numbering of the Y axis is reversed from version 4.x.  So,
          the value of Y now increases towards the north.

     ==  If  the "relative coordinates" option is enabled, each nation
          will have a central reference point  (usually  the  national
          Capital),  upon  which  all  other coordinate values will be
          based.  {Ex., the sector to the northeast of  the  reference
          sector is [1][1] and that to the west is [-1][0].}

     == If the "check logins" option is enabled, only the owner of the
          nation will be able to log into a nation, even if the  pass­
          word is known.

     ==  The  display system has been entirely reconfigured.  Not only
          can the display "zoom", but there are also four possible si­
          multaneous  displays  on the most detailed zoom setting, in­
          stead of the old method of having two display styles at  all
          times.

     == The world generator is greatly enhanced, producing worlds that
          are much more realistic in land mass shaping.  A new  curses
          interface  has  also  been  provided  during world creation,
          which contains many more global options.

     == The size of the world can be up to 256x256 in dimensions.   If
          desired,  this limitation can be removed during compilation,
          and a world of any size (within the scope of the platform on
          which  Conquer  is  running)  can  be specified.  {Note that
          changing this particular compilation option will make previ­
          ous world data structures incompatible}.

     == A new altitude of valley (v) has been added.

     ==  Sectors now contain major and minor designations.  This means
          that a sector has a specified main use, and the minor desig­
          nations  indicate  attributes  of the sector.  So, it is now
          possible to have a town sector which has roads going through
          it, and a blacksmith in residence.

     ==  A  new  raw  material of "wood" has been added.  This is used
          mainly in the construction of ships and fortifications.

     == Raw materials are no longer  gathered  on  a  national  basis.
          They are now located in caches, stockades, towns, cities and
          the Capital.  This means that production and distribution of
          resources  will have to be handled on a city by city, region
          by region basis.  This also means that sieges  will  have  a
          greater  effect, since a sector under siege will have to de­
          pend on the its own resources until the siege is broken.

     == Capturing of sectors now  takes  place  only  during  updates.
          This  eliminates  a  number of "race conditions" which would
          cause serious problems whenever two players  tried  to  take
          the same sector on the same turn.

     == The number of men needed to capture a sector is now determined
          by the population of the sector being captured, not the pop­
          ulation of the nation doing the capturing.

     ==  Non-city sectors may now be captured if an overwhelming force
          of troops is within the sector.  For city sectors,  all  de­
          fenders must still be eliminated before a sector may be tak­
          en.

     == Caravans have been added.  Caravans are used like  navies,  to
          transport  goods along the land.  They are of minimal effec­
          tiveness in combat.

     == All of the data structures within Conquer are now  dynamic  in
          nature.   There is no limit on the number of armies, navies,
          or caravans a nation may possess, but the cost for units now
          includes  a  base  surcharge for each unit.  This means that
          two army units of 75 men each are more  expensive  than  one
          army unit of the same type with 150 men.  {This was done for
          the sake of realism and out of a need to discourage  an  ex­
          cessive number of small units}

     ==  Monster  units  of the same type may now be grouped together.
          Monsters still have a relative strength greater than that of
          a  normal  soldier,  but  since that value is a constant, it
          need not be stored in the strength  data  of  every  monster
          unit.

     ==  Leader  units  now earn experience.  The strength of a leader
          will increase as time goes on, reflecting greater  skill  in
          the leader.

     == Leaders may now be grouped under other leaders.

     ==  Scouting  is no longer an accessible army status.  Scouts and
          spies must always be drafted.

     == Types of movement are now separate from statuses.   The  speed
          of  a  unit  may  be  any  of Slow, Normal, March or Flight.
          MARCH and FLIGHT have, therefore, been removed as  statuses.

     == The status of AMBUSH has been added.

     ==  The  magical  enhancement of a troop is now separate from the
          status of the unit.  So, for example, a unit may now  be  in
          magically enhanced garrison mode.

     ==  The  status  of  a  group  leader indicates the status of the
          group.  This means that a group is no longer just an  attack
          force.

     ==  A unit Garrisoned in a wall sector may be moved to any neigh­
          boring wall sector once  per  turn.   [This  implements  pa­
          trolling along a wall]

     == Navies (and caravans) now possess statuses.

     ==  There  are  now  four  ship types, each with a given purpose:
          Barges (to carry carvans),  Galleys  (to  carry  civilians),
          Warships  (to carry army units), and Merchants (to carry raw
          materials).

     == Combat between land and naval forces is now possible.

     == Extended commands (via the ESC-key in version 4.x) may now  be
          performed on navies and caravans as well as armies.

     == There are many more extended commands available.

     == The mail facility has been enhanced.

     ==  It  is  now  possible  to  bind  keys, including multiple key
          strokes, to Conquer functions.

     == All of the display mode combinations may be reorganized by the
          player.

     ==  The trading board has been removed; the new method of trading
          requires the transportation of ships or caravans to the  lo­
          cation of where trading takes place.  [NOT IMPLEMENTED]

     ==  The production and budget screens have been rewritten and are
          now geared around regional reports.

     == Spells are cast by the individual leader units,  whose  spell­
          casting  ability  is  governed  on  an individual basis.  ==
          There are specific  leader  types,  known  as  spellcasters,
          which should have most of the burden of the spell powers.

     ==  The new designation of "shrine" is used as a location for the
          spell casting leaders to regain their magical  strength  for
          spell casting.

     ==  The new designation of "wall" is used as a defensive position
          to limit the movement of enemy  troops.   Patrols  may  move
          along neighboring wall sectors, extending defensive lines.

     ==  Farms  must  now  be cultivated in order to fully utilize the
          production ability of the sector.  A  "farm"  is  designated
          during  the spring, becomes "fertile" during the summer, and
          "fruitful" during the fall.  An interruption  of  the  cycle
          causes  less  than  optimal production during the summer and
          fall seasons. {This means that sectors will have to be  held
          during  the  entire year, or captured unharmed, for the full
          fall yield to be realized}

     == Army units may be upgraded to a better unit type for a reduced
          cost.

     ==  Minor  designations  are used to determine the sector status.
          The "devastated" minor designation indicates  a  sector  has
          been  ruined,  and  its production will by 1/4 of normal.  A
          minor designation of "sieged" is used to indicate  a  sector
          where  enemy  troops  have successfully blockaded the sector
          owner and allies.

     == Supply centers are able to give out and receive supplies  from
          sectors  within a given range of sectors.  This range is de­
          termined by the sector designation,  seasonal  conditionals,
          national  skills and other factors.  Any sectors outside the
          range of all supply centers must be supported  using  navies
          or  caravans  or  else the sector will be "unsupported", and
          people will starve and the structures decay.

     == The new designation of "cache" has been added which provides a
          place  for  storing items which is not visible to any nation
          but the sector owner.

     == The main map display can be made to display more detailed  in­
          formation about the current sector.  Simply use the "toggle-
          infomode" command to adjust how the display is used.

     == A full screen loading interface has  been  provided  to  allow
          easier transfer of goods between supply centers, navies, and
          caravans.

     == A configuration file, ".conqrc" has  been  provided  to  allow
          easy  customization  of the Conquer environment.  Customiza­
          tion commands are placed in this file and read in at  start­
          up.  Conquer can automatically generate a configuration file
          for a player, through the use of the "store-settings" option
          under the "conquer-options" command.

     ==  The  Conquer  god  or demi-god may now disable user logins at
          will.

     == Movement is now on a percentage scheme.  All  units  start  at
          "100"  and  movement  between  sectors will deduct a certain
          percentage of the movement  ability  from  the  unit.   This
          scheme  is  easier for most people to understand, and yet is
          still basically the same as the other schemes.
