
The Power of God

     A  world in Conquer is a complex thing, and needs to have someone
     to watch over it.  The creation of the world, the updating of the
     turns,  and the monitoring of events are all assigned to the con­
     trol of one person.  It is that person's responsibility  to  make
     sure that the game flows smoothly and fairly.  The title of "god"
     is given to this person, and any aspect of the game  may  be  ad­
     justed by them.

     There  are times when players will be unable to get their nations
     started properly, such as if there are no metal or  wood  sectors
     near them, or if, though pure bad luck, they are placed on a very
     small island.  Or, the nation might accidently lose all of  their
     money  by  drafting  the wrong type of unit by accident.  In such
     situations, god may add land or resources to the nation,  disband
     troops  and return spent resources, or even give gifts of wood or
     metals to the nation to provide them with a second chance.

     If the site is large enough, or the tasks of  the  god  too  time
     consuming,  it is possible for the god to give another player the
     ability to be a "god" to a world.  Such a person would be  called
     a  "demi-god".   In  this way, many campaigns may take place on a
     single machine, with different demi-gods monitoring  each.   This
     provides the ideal environment for players, where they can have a
     variety of worlds, each one configured just a bit differently.

Genesis:  A Conquer Cookbook

     To begin a Conquer game, there must first be a world  upon  which
     to  run  the campaign.  A Conquer world is created using the com­
     mand:

        conqrun -m -d campaign

     If an empty string is specified [conqrun -m -d ""], then the  de­
     fault Conquer campaign is assumed.  If no '-d' flag is used, then
     either the default campaign is used, or  the  campaign  specified
     using  the CONQ_OPTS environment variable is used.  [For more in­
     formation, see Customize]

     Once a check is made to be sure that the world creation  is  both
     allowed  and desired, a startup screen is displayed.  After a key
     press, Conquer will prompt you to enter super-user  password  for
     the new world.  This password will be used whenever access to god
     powers is needed, to preserve security.  Once that has  been  en­
     tered, the configuration screen will be presented to you.

The Configuration Screen

     The configuration screen is a mode where the world parameters can
     be specified, and where different options can be enabled or  dis­
     abled.  The screen itself will look something like:

     If your terminal supports it, the current item will be highlight­
     ed.  In any case, the cursor will be  placed  after  the  current
     item.   If  the  new  world is being created over an old one, the
     configuration of the prior world will be kept, otherwise the  de­
     fault configuration will be used.

     To  change  a  configuration option, use the VI movement keys, or
     the numeric keypad, to move to the selection you wish to  change,
     and hit the `c' or ESCAPE key.  Then enter a new value.  When you
     are done specifying the world parameters, enter a `q' if you wish
     to  build  the  new  world or a `Q' if you wish to abort the cre­
     ation.

Configuration Options

     In order to clarify what each of the possible  configuration  op­
     tions  is,  I have provided a description of each of them.  Those
     with an asterisk (*) following the name  are  adjustable  at  any
     time after the world has been built:

     Demi-god*  --  During  compilation,  the user who is empowered to
          control all of the Conquer campaigns is specified using  the
          LOGIN  definition  in  the header.h file.  While it would be
          nice if a single person could manage all  of  the  campaigns
          that a site would want to run, experience has shown that on­
          ly with large amounts of caffeine would it be close to  pos­
          sible.

          Thus,  the demi-god is born!  The demi-god is the login name
          of the person that god designates  to  run  that  particular
          world.   The  powers  of the demi-god may be limited to just
          world updating, or can include all of the  powers  that  god
          possesses but only for that particular world.

          Whether  or  not  a  world has been assigned a demi-god, the
          powers, if not the responsibilities, of god will remain  the
          same.

          The string "[none]" may be used to specify that there should
          be no demi-god for a campaign.

     God Passwd* -- In order to access all of the  powers  of  god,  a
          password  will  need  to be entered.  This option allows the
          adjustment of the password.  Demi-gods  must  know  the  old
          password before changing it.

     Add  Passwd*  --  After a number of game turns have passed, users
          will be asked to enter a password before  being  allowed  to
          create  a  new  nation.  This option controls the setting of
          that password.  Demi-gods must know the old password  before
          being allowed to change it.

     Limited  D-god*  -- If set, this option will prevent the demi-god
          from being able to enter the nation  "god",  and  will  also
          prevent  the  demi-god from being able to rebuild the world.
          In essence, this means that the demi-god will only  be  able
          to update the game.

     D-god  builds*  --  If  this option is set to "False", the person
          designated as the demi-god will not be able to  rebuild  the
          world  and  start a new game.  This is useful for preventing
          people from starting a new campaign  without  checking  with
          god first.

     Map  Type -- This is a nice, nifty, neato-keen, feature which al­
          lows you to determine what map will be used for a  campaign.
          The two possible choices are HexMap and RectMap.

          The  RectMap  is the plain old 8 directional coordinate sys­
          tem.  The HexMap, on the other hand, is  where  each  sector
          has  only  6 neighboring sectors, and all sectors are joined
          by the edges.  The Hexagonal coordinate  system  is  a  much
          more  realistic  system  and should be the preferred system,
          but the RectMap is provided as an alternative for those  who
          wish to use it.

     Relative  Map*  -- If this option is set to "True", everyone, ex­
          cept god, will have sector locations displayed as the  rela­
          tive displacement between the current location and some cen­
          tral sector [By default, the  national  capital.]   So,  the
          sector  one up and to the left of the capital will appear to
          be [-1,1] to that nation.

          The reason this feature was added was to decrease the amount
          of  help player nations can give each other if they have not
          actually met.  [I can't put limitations on the mail  system,
          since  they  can  just  use the normal computer mail if they
          want... this feature serves as a nice compromise.]

     Verify Login* -- Each nation has, stored  within  it,  the  login
          name of the person who created it.  If this option is set to
          "True", only that person will be allowed access to  the  na­
          tion.   This acts as an added security feature and will also
          enable a check preventing people from creating more than one
          nation,  attempting  to  thus  gain an advantage by doubling
          their information resources.  [I got sick and tired of  hav­
          ing to delete nations created by people who would create two
          or three nations and then play out the one with  the  better
          starting position.  Annoying cheaters!]

     Hide  Scores*  --  If this configuration option is set to "True",
          any information which could possibly  determine  a  national
          strength  or  ability will be hidden from players during the
          various score reports.

     Hide Users* -- If set to "True", the identity of the nation  own­
          ers  will not be displayed during score reports to other na­
          tions.

     Late Start* -- After a number of turns have been  played  in  the
          game,  nation  creation will not be allowed for all players.
          This option controls how long, in game turns,  before  users
          will  be asked for the Add Passwd when trying to build a new
          nation.

     World X Size --
     World Y Size -- These two options control the size of  the  world
          used  in the campaign.  The larger the world, the longer be­
          fore nations meet, and, thus, the longer the game.  When ad­
          justing  the  size  of the world, be sure to also adjust the
          number of monsters and NPC nations within the world.

     Max Build Pts* -- When creating nations using  the  "conqrun  -a"
          interface,  each of the options within the nation configura­
          tion is assigned a "cost" which will be  deducted  from  the
          construction  points remaining.  The "Max Build Pts" are the
          total number of construction points which a nation  will  be
          given at the start of the nation building process.

     Min  Ntn Dist* -- This setting is used to determine how far apart
          nations' capitals must be when initially placed.  Be sure to
          reduce this value if you are building a small world.

     Navy Bonus* --
     Cvan  Bonus* -- During combat between the various military units,
          each unit is assigned a combat bonus.  Army units are  given
          a  default bonus of zero, which is then adjusted by the com­
          bat bonus of the particular army type.   These  two  options
          control  the  adjustment  of the combat bonuses for navy and
          caravan units, and can have a great affect on the results of
          combat for those units.

     Combat  Dice*  -- When a military conflict occurs within Conquer,
          Conquer will roll a number of combat dice to  determine  the
          outcome  of  the  battle.  With more dice, a more pronounced
          bell curve is given, but more time is  required  to  compute
          the results.  With less dice, the bell curve becomes flatter
          and the results become much more random, but the results are
          more quickly determined.

          The "conqrun -Q" command is available to set and/or test the
          various dice settings available.  For example, on my system,
          the  results show that using 9 dice is superior to using 10,
          since the algorithm used ends up with a smaller standard de­
          viation at that setting.

     Avg Damage* -- During combat, there is a certain amount of damage
          which will occur to each troop.  The  "Avg  Damage"  is  the
          damage  that a military unit will receive if it were to meet
          a unit of the same combat strength  and  a  balanced  result
          takes  place.  Increasing this value makes combats more dev­
          astating to all units involved.

     Deter Damage* -- Attacking forces will keep on searching for ene­
          my  troops until they have engaged all enemy forces, or they
          have received enough damage in one encounter to  cause  them
          to  turn  back.  This selection controls what that amount of
          damage is.

     Overmatch* -- When the number of troops is larger for one side in
          an  engagement than the other, the combat damage will be ad­
          justed by this percentage for each odds level of  a  combat.
          For example, with an Overmatch value of 10% and if side A is
          3 times the size of side B, side  A's  damage  will  be  de­
          creased  by  20% and side B's will be increased by 20%.  In­
          creasing this value increases the affect of numerical  supe­
          riority.

     Min  Damage* -- This setting indicates the minimum amount of dam­
          age which a unit must receive, based  on  the  combat  roll.
          This is calculated after the Overmatch to assure that a mil­
          itary unit will suffer something for the battle.  So,  if  a
          unit  would  have  received  25% damage, but by Overmatch it
          went below zero, the troop would get an actual damage result
          of  5%x25%  or  1.25%  worth  of damage.  This is calculated
          based on a Min Damage value of 5%.

     Year* --
     Month* -- During world creation you may specify a different  time
          at which the game is to begin.  This is mostly provided as a
          cosmetic feature, but by specifying a different  month,  you
          can control the season during which the campaign will begin.
          You might want to refer to the calendar information, to  get
          a  clear  idea  of  the dating scheme used by Conquer.  [For
          more information, see Overview]

     Pct Water -- This item is also fairly straight forward.  It  con­
          trols how much of the world should be composed of water sec­
          tors.  I recommend at least fifty percent to make the use of
          naval  fleets worthwhile, even higher if you wish to require
          the use of such units.

     Pct Contour -- This option controls what percentage of  the  sec­
          tors  which  are  land sectors should be non-flat in nature.
          Non-flat means any of: Valley, Hill, Mountains, or  Mountain
          Peak.

     Expose  Ratio*  --  This  value  controls how hazardous it is for
          troops to be out in bad weather or vegetation.  Lowering the
          value makes it less hazardous for troops.

     Smoothings  -- This item is the most important in determining the
          general shape of the land masses in the world.   The  number
          entered  under this option means literally what it says: the
          number of times a smoothing algorithm is run on the world.

          The smoothing algorithm is simple: on a N%  (currently  33%)
          chance,  change  the  current sector to be land or water de­
          pending on whether there is more water or land  within  a  2
          sector  radius.   The  altitude of the land sectors are also
          raised or lowered depending on  if  there  are  more  things
          nearby which are higher or lower.

          Setting  this number to 1 creates a very splotchy world with
          a large number of small islands scattered around,  and  set­
          ting  it to the highest value (15), creates a world of solid
          land masses with no small islands.  [Except for pirate bases
          which are ALWAYS single sector mountainous islands]

          I  usually  choose  a value between 5 and 7 depending on how
          many little islands I want to have scattered throughout  the
          world.

     Check Range --
     Pct  Reject -- These two options control the initial placement of
          the solid 8x8 blocks of land.  All of the solid land  masses
          are  placed,  with  surrounding blocks of "75% land, 25% wa­
          ter", at random.  A check is made of  blocks  within  "Check
          Range"  to  determine if there is already land close by.  If
          there is, that location will be rejected on a  "Pct  Reject"
          chance, and a new location will be selected.

          A  larger  range  and higher percentage causes more separate
          continental islands to be placed, while lowering  them  will
          allow  the possibility for a single dominant land mass to be
          formed.

     Pct Tgoods --
     % Metals --
     % Jewels --
     % Magical -- These  options  control  the  amount  of  tradegoods
          placed  during  the creation of the world.  The "Pct Tgoods"
          is the percent chance that a land sector will  contain  some
          form  of  tradegood, and the other percentages indicate what
          chance there is that a tradegood will be of the given  type.

          Since  there  are  types of tradegoods other than the metal,
          jewel, and magical tradegoods, there is a limit to the  com­
          bined percentage of those options.

     Growth Rate* -- The player nations, NPC nations and monster units
          within Conquer each will slowly grow in size as time passes.
          The  growth  is controlled by the reproductive rates of each
          of the nations and the "Monst Repro" and "% Mnst Mercs" set­
          tings  for monsters.  It is possible to globally increase or
          decrease the reproductive ability by adjusting  this  value.
          Increasing  this  value  increases the rate at which nations
          will grow.

     Npc Ntns -- This controls the number of non-player character  na­
          tions  that  are created when the world is built.  These na­
          tions are read from the "nations" data file, so it  is  also
          limited  by the number of entries within that file.  You may
          use the "conqrun -A" command to add more nations to the "na­
          tions"  file,  and the "conqrun -Z" command to remove all of
          the nations.

     Monster Repro* -- This selection controls how quickly the monster
          nation populations increase on a yearly basis.  It is offset
          by both the death of the  monster  races  (lizards,  nomads,
          savages,  pirates  and  peasant  rebellions) from combat, as
          well as setting of the "% Mnst Mercs" option.

     Lizards -- This indicates exactly how many lizard castles  should
          be placed upon the world.  Each lizard castle will be placed
          upon a highly valuable jewel tradegood, and will have forti­
          fications  consistent  with  the  jewel level of the sector.
          Two lizard army troops will be  guarding  each  castle:  one
          roaming  infantry  troop,  and  one garrisoned archer troop.
          The combat bonus of the lizard troops is that of the  merce­
          naries during the build, plus 20 to the defensive bonus.

     Savages  -- Units of this nation randomly roam about the world as
          agressive army units.  Half of all of the savage troops  are
          actually  monster  units  of some type, with the size an in­
          verse ratio to the strength of the troop, the remaining unit
          are randomly sized infantry troops.  Combat bonuses for sav­
          ages are those of mercenaries at  the  time  the  world  was
          built.

     Nomads  -- This nation is composed of a number of armies of Light
          Cavalry.  They must move every turn, never  staying  in  any
          sector  for  more  than  a month.  The combat bonus of nomad
          armies is that of the mercenaries at  build  time,  plus  10
          more to the attack bonus.

     Pirates  --  Controlling the seas, these pirate bases each have a
          fleet of warships and an army  of  soldiers  protecting  its
          horde of minerals.  The combat bonus of the pirate nation is
          that of the mercenaries at build time, with an adjustment of
          plus 20 to the attack, and minus 10 to the defense.

     Revolt Pct* -- Every turn, each nation will have a certain chance
          that the population will rebel and break away from the moth­
          er  nation.  This item is used as a multiplier of the calcu­
          lated chance to influence the chance of  revolts.   Thus,  a
          setting  of  100% means no adjustment, while a setting of 0%
          prevents revolts altogether.

     Scout Capture* -- This indicates the chance that  scouts  may  be
          dragged into combat and possibly be destroyed.

     Rand  Events*  --  On  the average, how many random (non-weather)
          events take place over the entire world during each  update.

     Disasters*  --  How  many random weather events should occur each
          update.

     Mercenaries* --
     Atck Bonus* --
     Dfns Bonus* -- These options control the amount and  strength  of
          the  mercenary  troops within the campaign.  It is also used
          as a base determinant for the "monster" nations.  Note: Once
          a  world  is  built,  God may change the mercenaries' combat
          bonus, but it will not affect the combat bonuses of the var­
          ious  monster  nations.   At  that point, the monster combat
          bonuses must be adjusted like that of any other nation.

     % Disb Mercs -- This option determines what  percentage  of  dis­
          banded troops decide to become mercenaries, instead of meek­
          ly becoming part of the population.

     % Mnst Mercs -- This option determines  what  percentage  of  men
          within the monster nations decide to join the pool of avail­
          able mercenaries each year.

     Max Diplo Adj* -- Each nation is able to  adjust  the  diplomatic
          status  it has for any nation it has met.  The value of this
          option determines the maximum adjustment  from  the  current
          diplomatic setting which may be made.  Keeping this value to
          1 or 2 means that it will not be possible to declare War  on
          a  nation  without  any prior warning.  Due to the diplomacy
          change not being visible to other nations until after an up­
          date,  it  is  recommended that a low value be used for this
          option.

     Bribery Value* -- This item sets  a  minimum  relative  value  at
          which a bribery is effective on an NPC nation.  It should be
          noted that the new bribery system simulates real events that
          can take place when nations send money to each other through
          envoys.  [ie., The envoy you sent disappeared with your mon­
          ey  and  was  last  seen  in the vicinity of the French Riv­
          iera...]

     Max Supply* -- Each army or other military unit may carry only so
          many months worth of food and pay with them.  This selection
          determines the limit as to how many months may be carried at
          one time.

     Unit  Sply  Dist* -- This option controls the distance over which
          the navies and caravans can provide support when they are on
          "Support"  status.  If this value is set to 0, they may only
          distribute to the current sector,  other  settings  indicate
          the  maximum  range  over  which they may distribute, with a
          value of -1 being entered to have them distribute  based  on
          the national communication range.

     City  Xfer  Dist* -- This selection controls the maximum distance
          which can separate two cities before they will be unable  to
          transfer  goods directly using the "region-command" transfer
          mechanism.  Like the Unit Sply Dist setting, entering  a  -1
          will  make  it conform to the communication range of the na­
          tion.

Changing Things Later On

     Once the world has already been created, there will  probably  be
     some times when god will have to make adjustments to the state of
     the campaign.  After all, what fun would it be to play god  with­
     out being able to "Play God"? :-)

     Anyway, the most basic of changes, such as turning on or off cam­
     paign options, is done through the an interface similar  to  that
     used  during world creation.  This is available through the "con­
     qrun -E" command.  Those options which are not able to be changed
     will  simply  not  allow themselves to be adjusted.  This command
     provides the only method available for god to change the campaign
     and add user passwords, if they should ever need changing.

     If  god  wishes  to adjust the number of dice to be rolled during
     combat, then the command "conqrun -Q" provides  a  interface  for
     viewing and adjusting the probably of various dice settings.  Any
     changes made to the Combat Dice here will  be  reflected  on  the
     world options.

     To  get a quick listing of some campaign settings, simply use the
     "conqrun -I" command.  Conquer will then display statistics about
     each nation that might be of interest to a campaign deity.

     Finally,  there  is the most powerful ability of god: the ability
     to change anything in any portion of the campaign.   Such  powers
     are  granted  by just logging in as nation "god".  [I often refer
     to this as "going into god-mode".]  Almost all  of  the  commands
     available  to normal players will also function for god, and each
     will also provide additional options which will allow god to  ma­
     nipulate  almost  any item.  It is simply a matter of determining
     which commands will do what for god, and that is what the remain­
     der of this section of the documentation is for...

How to do God's Work

     Well,  as  I  said earlier, many of the normal user commands will
     simply function differently if you are logged in as  god.   Also,
     when  god wishes to adjust some information about a given nation,
     god will, for a short period of time,  become  that  nation,  and
     will  then  be able to manipulate that nations' sectors, units or
     cities.  So, in order for god to adjust items for a nation,  that
     nation  must  not be logged in.  This is to prevent conflicts be­
     tween adjustments god might make and adjustments a  player  might
     make.

     It  should  be  noted that god will only assume the identity of a
     nation for the duration of the  individual  commands.   For  some
     commands,  such as "move-unit", god will automatically assume the
     identity of the nation that owns the current unit.   For  others,
     such as "economy-report" or "enlist", god will be queried for the
     name of the nation to become.

     As Conquer is currently implemented, god will  retain  the  login
     "lock" on any nation that is adjusted.  This is to avoid any con­
     flicts that might develop from reading in  the  commands  already
     issued  by a nation more than once.  So, if you wish to release a
     lock on an edited nation, you must get out of god-mode.

Making Adjustments

     There are many different objects within Conquer,  each  of  which
     has  a variety of commands which may affect it.  Whenever god ac­
     cesses a function which may make changes, a nation name to  apply
     the  changes to will be asked for.  Some commands, such as "move-
     unit" will automatically assume that the nation owning  the  cur­
     rent  unit  will be the one affected.  Whenever god makes changes
     to a nation, that nation may not be using Conquer, so once god is
     done makes changes, it would be a good idea to log out.

     The  following  list  is to let god know which commands to use to
     get various tasks done:

     adjusting army units -- Army units  may  be  adjusted  using  the
          "army-report"  or  "group-report"  functions.  The "command-
          unit" function will also change a limited subset of unit in­
          formation.

     adjusting caravans -- Caravans may be manipulated using the "car­
          avan-report" or "command-unit" functions, much  as  an  army
          unit.

     adjusting  naval  units  --  Navies  may be manipulated using the
          "navy-report" or "command-unit" functions, just like  armies
          and caravans.

     relocating a unit -- Armies, navies and caravans may be relocated
          using the "move-unit" function.  The currently selected unit
          will be the one to be relocated.

     creating  a unit -- A unit may be created using the "enlist" com­
          mand or using the  appropriate  "{navy,caravan,army}-report"
          function.

     disbanding a unit -- A unit may be deleted by using the "command-
          unit" function or the  appropriate  "{navy,caravan,army}-re­
          port" function.

     changing material amounts within a supply center -- The amount of
          raw materials within a supply center may be  adjusted  using
          either  the  "economy-report"  interface or the "region-com­
          mand" function.

     changing material amounts stored on a unit -- The amount  of  raw
          materials  on  a caravan or a navy may be adjusted using the
          "navy-report" or "caravan-report" funtions, as  appropriate.

     changing  supply  levels  on a unit -- The supply levels on units
          may be adjusted individually using the "command-unit"  func­
          tion  or  the  appropriate "{navy,caravan,army}-report func­
          tion.  Global adjustments may be performed  using  the  "re­
          gion-command" function.

     renaming  a supply center -- Supply centers may be renamed by us­
          ing the "region-command" function.

     renaming a nation -- Nations may be renamed using the "nation-in­
          fo" function.

     changing the owner of a nation -- The login name for the owner of
          a nation must be changed using the "nation-info" command.

     adjusting national statistics -- National attributes, such as the
          eat  and communication rates, may be adjusted using the "na­
          tion-info" command.

     deleting a nation -- Nations may only be deleted through the "na­
          tion-info" command.

     creating  a  nation  -- Nations must be created using the conqrun
          program, with the -a flag.  Additional NPC  nations  may  be
          added  by creating a nation and then using the "nation-info"
          command to change the nation to a non-player nation.

     changing the constructions of a sector -- The constructions with­
          in  a  sector  may be changed using the "construct" command.
          Removal of old constructions is done by devastating the sec­
          tor.

     changing  any other information about a sector -- The owner, con­
          tour, designation, population, vegetation, trade  good,  and
          many  other  traits  of a sector may be changed by using the
          "change-designation" function.

     relocating people from a sector -- The "move-people" function may
          also  be used by god to change the population of two sectors
          at the same time.

     changing the magical powers a nation possesses -- The  "magic-in­
          fo"  function  may  be  used to add to or take away from the
          magical powers a nation has.

     casting spells -- God may cast any spell upon any sector or  unit
          by using the "cast-spells" function.

     call  down  a natural disaster -- The "cast-spells" function also
          allows god to erupt volcanos, shake the earth, or call  down
          other natural disasters.

     going  to a specific capital -- It is possible to go to the capi­
          tal of any nation using the "jump-to-capital" command.

     going to a specific city -- It is possible to go directly to  any
          city in the world using the "city-choose" function.

     going  to  a specific unit -- To jump directly to any unit in any
          nation,  the  "army-choose",  "navy-choose",  and  "caravan-
          choose" functions are available.

     going to a specific sector -- To relocate to a given sector, just
          use the "jump-to-pick" function.

     giving a message to players during startup -- While in  god-mode,
          use the "edit-motd" function to start an editor for the mes­
          sage of the day.  The "conquer -M" program may also be used,
          if  you  do  not  wish  to log into Conquer just to edit the
          MOTD.

     kick players out of the game -- You may prevent players from log­
          ging  into  Conquer by using the "conqrun -T" program.  This
          should give them a short delay before they are automatically
          logged out, if they are currently in the program.

     update  the  game -- A very important aspect of godhood is having
          to update the world.  The program "conqrun -x"  is  used  to
          update  the  program,  and  depending on how it was compiled
          will wait until all players have logged out, preventing fur­
          ther  logins, and then update the world.  Using this program
          with an automated script program, such as "at" on Unix,  can
          make life much easier for a god.

     A  detailed  listing of which keys are bound to what functions is
     listed elsewhere in the documentation.   [For  more  information,
