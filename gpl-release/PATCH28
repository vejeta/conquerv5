Patch 28 contains a complete rewrite of the documentation.  All but the
"Quickies" section has been completed.  This will be pretty much the
final form of the documentation, so please give me any feedback on it
that you can.

Patch 28 also contains a number of structural adjustments and expansions
for future coding.  The NPC code is still incomplete, but I have a backbone
in place now.  There were also a large number of bug fixes, including the
locating of one or two tricky bugs that were causing some strange
behaviors.

I. Installing this patch
========================

If you received conquer as a full tar file (cq5beta-28.tar.Z) you
may just skip this set of directions, but you might still need to
use the information inside the CONVERTING file if you have any old
campaigns in place.

	0. Make sure to update any old campaigns with the old version
	   of conqrun so that the "*.exc" files are not out of
	   alignment.  [See the file CONVERTING for more information.]

	1. First type "make clobber" while in the conquer directory.

	2. Unpack the patch, installing any files to their appropriate
	   locations.  Then run "patch -p < diff.p28" when in the
	   conquer directory.

	3. Remove all "*.orig" files and check for any "*.rej" files.
	   If there are any rejections, see if you can find out why
	   they failed and get in touch with me.  [vejeta@gmail.com or https://github.com/vejeta/conquerv5/issues]

	4. Copy the file "Include/header.h.dist" to "Include/header.h"
	   and edit the file to make any selections needed for your
	   machine.

        5. Copy the file "Makefile.top" to "Makefile" and then edit
	   the file to make any selections needed for your machine.

	6. Type "make mkfiles" to build the new Makefiles.

	7. Type "make build" to build the new version.

	8. If there are any problems (undeclared functions, improperly
	   declared functions, etc.) you might need to edit the
	   "Include/sysconf.h" file.  [IF YOU DO... PLEASE LET ME KNOW
	   SO I CAN FIX IT IN THE FUTURE!!!  vejeta@gmail.com or https://github.com/vejeta/conquerv5/issues]

	9. Type "make install" to install it.

       10. Once the build is complete, you want to be sure that you
	   finish the conversion process of old data files by running
	   the "conqrun -E" program as recommended in CONVERTING.

II. What files are new to this patch.
=====================================

The files which are new to this patchlevel:

	PATCH28		- this file; resides in toplevel directory.
        executeX.h      - defines new exec codes; place in Include/
        Economics.nr    - economics documentation; place in Docs/
        Nations.nr      - ntn+race documentation; place in Docs/
        Quickies.nr     - empty doc file; place in Docs/
        Version.nr      - version and history docs; place in Docs/
        Xchanges.nr     - mail system documentation; place in Docs/

III. What files may be removed.
===============================

If you desire, the file PATCH27 is no longer needed.  But, it does
have some important notes which you might want to hold onto.

Also, the file Src/CHANGES may be removed as it is an outdated note to
myself.

IV. Changes made in this patch.
===============================

	=== Movement now handles fractions of a percentage.

	=== Fixed the sorting program to not remove blank lines from news.

	=== New documentation files have been added and old ones have
	    been rewritten.  [These account for well over half of all
	    of all the changes.]

	=== The "Version" information is now contained in a doc file.

	=== Replaced many of the #define statements with enumerated
	    types.  This should allow for easier compilation on some
	    older machines, if, of course, they support enums. :-)

        === Added a definable "Late Start" campaign variable.

	=== Added a "Growth Rate" setting to allow the adjustment of
	    global reproduction rates.

	=== Expanded the city structure to contain information for a
	    future automatic distribution system.  Will still need
	    some changes for a full implementation.

	=== Fixed a bug in the abrt() macro.

	=== After enlisting the newly drafted unit will be selected.

	=== Any unit with speed of "stuck" will be set to "normal"
	    speed when unloaded from a ship.

	=== The "following" has been clarified in the army reports.

	=== The currency attribute is now calculated.

	=== Decreased the value of soldiers during the nation creation
	    mode.

	=== Fixed a bug with the Maximum Efficiency being written to
	    the data file after the Efficiency value.

	=== Clarified the message given when Sortie is selected.

	=== Properly handle unlinking from a group when changing the
	    unit status.

	=== Make sure that the last_loc information is always traced
	    for a unit, even when in a group.

	=== Made sure the -l option of conquer checked the hide-login
	    campaign option.

	=== Increased the combat bonuses due to speed.

	=== Tweaked the combat code slightly to handle small vs. large
	    confrontations.

	=== Expanded check for new army unit number.

	=== Fixed the poptoworkers function to not confuse some
	    compilers.

	=== Added the header-mode option to the configuration and
	    environment setups.

	=== Added the system mail checker option to the configuration
	    and environment setups.

	=== Tweaked the attractiveness of sectors.

	=== Fixed the data entries for Archery and Armor, same
	    information was missing. [OOPS!]

	=== The speed for fleets has been increased.

	=== The display mode editor now has a an abort option.

	=== The unit side display is now more consistent... movement
	    left and speed are now side by side at all times.

	=== Space characters may now be used to represent various
	    vegetations or elevations.

	=== Mine overworkings are now reported in economic summaries.

	=== The MOTD is now shown with score reports.

	=== Added the reverse shift focus command to the movement
	    functions.

	=== Fixed some bugs in the displaying of status selections for
	    navies and caravans.
