This directory is to contain source code for programs other
than the standard conquer binaries.

The list of programs:

cextract   -- A set of routines written to generate proper prototypes from
              C source code.  Two programs currently make use of the code:
              cextract and cextdoc.  The cextract program is used to build
              C header files for multi-file projects, and the cextdoc code
              is used to automatically generate documentation from C source
              code in either straight text or troff format.  Feel free to
              examine or make use of the code, as they may be distributed
              separately from conquer.

conqsort   -- a sorting program written specifically for conquer because of
              many problems with the standard unix "sort" program.

psmap      -- a postscript map generator for conquer version 4.9. This has
              not yet been ported to version 5.0 map output.
